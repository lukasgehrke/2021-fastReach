  abstract = "Future neuroprosthetic devices, in particular upper limb, will
              require decoding and executing not only the user's intended
              movement type, but also when the user intends to execute the
              movement. This work investigates the potential use of brain
              signals recorded non-invasively for detecting the time before a
              self-paced reaching movement is initiated which could contribute
              to the design of practical upper limb neuroprosthetics. In
              particular, we show the detection of self-paced reaching movement
              intention in single trials using the readiness potential, an
              electroencephalography (EEG) slow cortical potential (SCP)
              computed in a narrow frequency range (0.1-1 Hz). Our experiments
              with 12 human volunteers, two of them stroke subjects, yield high
              detection rates prior to the movement onset and low detection
              rates during the non-movement intention period. With the proposed
              approach, movement intention was detected around 500 ms before
              actual onset, which clearly matches previous literature on
              readiness potentials. Interestingly, the result obtained with one
              of the stroke subjects is coherent with those achieved in healthy
              subjects, with single-trial performance of up to 92\% for the
              paretic arm. These results suggest that, apart from contributing
              to our understanding of voluntary motor control for designing
              more advanced neuroprostheses, our work could also have a direct
              impact on advancing robot-assisted neurorehabilitation.",

              role of the RP in movement preparation have remained heavily
              debated. Although the RP is influenced by several motorical and
              cognitive factors, it has remained unclear whether people can
              learn to exert mental control over their RP, for example, by
              deliberately suppressing it. If people were able to initiate
              spontaneous movements without eliciting an RP, this would
              challenge the idea that the RP is a necessary stage of the causal
              chain leading up to a voluntary movement. We tested the ability
              of participants to control the magnitude of their RP in a

  abstract = "A central objective in the study of volition has been to identify
              how changes in neural activity relate to voluntary-``free
              will''-movement. The readiness potential (RP) is observed in the
              EEG as a slow-building signal that precedes action onset. Many
              consider the RP as a marker of an underlying preparatory process
              for initiating voluntary movement. However, the RP may emerge
              from ongoing slow-wave brain oscillations that influence the
              timing of movement initiation in a phase-dependent manner.
              Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) enables brain
              oscillations to be entrained at the frequency of stimulation. We
              delivered tACS at a slow-wave frequency over frontocentral motor
              areas while participants (n = 30) performed a simple, self-paced
              button press task. During the active tACS condition, participants
              showed a tendency to initiate actions in the phase of the tACS
              cycle that corresponded to increased negative potentials across
              the frontocentral motor region. Comparisons of premovement EEG
              activity observed over frontocentral and central scalp electrodes
              showed earlier onset and increased amplitude of RPs from active
              stimulation compared with sham stimulation. This suggests that
              movement-related activity in the brain can be modulated by the
              delivery of weak, nonconsciously perceptible alternating currents
              over frontocentral motor regions. We present novel findings that
              support existing theories, which suggest the timing of voluntary

              intention for action was laid by B. Libet et al. [(1983) Brain
              106, 623-642]. They reported the time of awareness of wanting to
              move to be about 0.2 s before voluntary movement onset. However,
              despite repeated confirmation of the result, their method has
              been criticised for its dependence on self-reported timing and
              subjective memory, and the interpretation has been widely debated
              without general consensus. Here, we show that the mean time of
              the conscious intention to move was 1.42 s before movement,
              estimated based on the subject's real-time decision of whether or
              not there was a thought to move when a tone occurred. This event
              is after the onset of the bereitschaftspotential, an
              electroencephalographic activity preceding voluntary movement,
              but about 1 s earlier than the timing of intention reported
              previously based on the subject's recall. Our result solves some
              problems of the conventional method, thus giving a clearer answer

              result and our result suggests that the perception of intention

  abstract  = "The sense of body ownership, knowledge that parts of our body
               `belong' to us, is presumably developed using sensory
               information. Cutaneous signals seem ideal for this and can
               modify the sense of ownership. For example, an illusion of
               ownership over an artificial rubber hand can be induced by
               synchronously stroking both the subject's hidden hand and a
               visible artificial hand. Like cutaneous signals, proprioceptive
               signals (e.g. frommuscle receptors) exclusively signal events
               occurring in the body, but the influence of proprioceptors on
               the sense of body ownership is not known. We developed a
               technique to generate an illusion of ownership over an
               artificial plastic finger, using movement at the proximal
               interphalangeal joint as the stimulus. We then examined this
               illusion in 20 subjects when their index finger was intact and
               when the cutaneous and joint afferents from the finger had been
               blocked by local anaesthesia of the digital nerves. Subjects
               still experienced an illusion of ownership, induced by movement,
               over the plastic finger when the digital nerves were blocked.
               This shows that local cutaneous signals are not essential for
               the illusion and that inputs arising proximally, presumably from
               receptors in muscles which move the finger, can influence the
               sense of body ownership. Contrary to other studies, we found no
               evidence that voluntary movements induce stronger illusions of
               body ownership than those induced by passive movement. It seems
               that the congruence of sensory stimuli ismore important to
               establish body ownership than the presence of multiple sensory
               signals.",

              Recently, a distinction between implicit and explicit aspects of
              sense of agency has been proposed, analogous to distinctions
              found in other areas of cognition, notably learning. However,
              there is yet no strong evidence supporting separable implicit and
              explicit components of sense of agency. The so-called 'Perruchet
              paradigm' offers one of the few convincing demonstrations of
              separable implicit and explicit learning systems. We adopted this
              approach to evaluate the implicit-explicit distinction in the
              context of a simple task in which outcomes were probabilistically
              caused by actions. In line with our initial predictions, we found
              evidence of a dissociation. We discuss the implications of this

              human abilities through medicine or technology. This has
              historically been achieved by consuming chemical substances that
              improve a selected ability or by installing implants which
              require medical operations. Both of these methods of augmentation
              can be invasive. Augmented abilities have also been achieved with
              external tools, such as eyeglasses, binoculars, microscopes or
              highly sensitive microphones. Lately, augmented reality and

              ways to augment human. In this article, we first discuss the
              field and related terms. We provide relevant definitions based on
              the present understanding of the field. This is followed by a

               human-computer interaction. Control has been investigated mainly
               at a high level, using subjective questionnaire data, but also
               at a low level, using objective data on participants' sense of
               agency. However, it remains unclear how differences in higher
               level, experienced control reflect lower level sense of control.
               We study that link in two experiments. In the first one we
               measure the low-level sense of agency with button, touchpad, and
               on-skin input. The results show a higher sense of agency with
               on-skin input. In the second experiment, participants played a
               simple game controlled with the same three inputs. We find that
               on-skin input results in both increased sense and experience of
               control compared to touchpad input. However, the corresponding
               difference is not found between on-skin and button input,
               whereas the button performed better in the experiment task.
               These results suggest that other factors of user experience

               exoskeletons or wearables based on electrical muscle stimulation
               (EMS), have the unique potential to accelerate users' own
               reaction time (RT). However, this speedup has only been explored
               while the device is attached to the user. In fact, very little
               is known regarding whether this faster reaction time still
               occurs after the user removes the device from their bodies--this
               is precisely what we investigated by means of a simple reaction
               time (RT) experiment, in which participants were asked to tap as
               soon as they saw an LED flashing. Participants experienced this
               in three EMS conditions: (1) fast-EMS, the electrical impulses
               were synced with the LED; (2) agency-EMS, the electrical impulse
               was delivered 40ms faster than the participant's own RT, which
               prior work has shown to preserve one's sense of agency over this
               movement; and, (3) late-EMS: the impulse was delivered after the
               participant's own RT. Our results revealed that the
               participants' RT was significantly reduced by approximately 8ms
               (up to 20ms) only after training with the agency-EMS condition.
               This finding suggests that the prioritizing agency during EMS
               training is key to motor-adaptation, i.e., it enables a faster
               motor response even after the user has removed the EMS device

               electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) or mechanical actuators;
               they preemptively move the user to perform a task, such as to
               improve movement performance (e.g., EMS-assisted drumming).
               Unfortunately, when using preemptive force-feedback users do not
               feel in control and loose their sense of agency. We address this
               by actuating the user's body, using EMS, within a particular
               time window (160 ms after visual stimulus), which we found to
               speed up reaction time by 80 ms in our first study. With this
               preemptive timing, when the user and system move congruently,
               the user feels that they initiated the motion, yet their
               reaction time is faster than usual. As our second study

              movement task to trigger cues upon the detection of a readiness
              potential (a well-characterized brain signal that precedes
              movement) or in its absence. The BCI-triggered cues instructed

              intention to trigger robot-assisted training in individuals
              without residual movements. METHODS: We compared movement
              intention detection using an EMG detector with a sensorimotor
              rhythm based EEG-BCI using only ipsilesional activity. This was
              carried out on data of 30 severely affected chronic stroke
              patients from a randomized control trial using an EEG-BCI for
              robot-assisted training. RESULTS: The results indicate the
              feasibility of using EMG to detect movement intention in this
              severely handicapped population; probability of detecting EMG
              when patients attempted to move was higher (p 0.001) than at
              rest. Interestingly, 22 out of 30 (or 73\%) patients had
              sufficiently strong EMG in their finger/wrist extensors.
              Furthermore, in patients with detectable EMG, there was poor
              agreement between the EEG and EMG intent detectors, which
              indicates that these modalities may detect different processes.
              CONCLUSION: A substantial segment of severely affected stroke
              patients may benefit from EMG-based assisted therapy. When
              compared to EEG, a surface EMG interface requires less
              preparation time, which is easier to don/doff, and is more
              compact in size. SIGNIFICANCE: This study shows that a large
              proportion of severely affected stroke patients have residual
              EMG, which yields a direct and practical way to trigger
              robot-assisted training.",

              people exceed the limitations of their human bodies, but this
              cannot be realized unless people choose to use these exciting
              technologies. Although human walking efficiency has been highly
              optimized over generations, exoskeletons have been able to
              consistently improve this efficiency by 10-15\%. However, despite
              these measurable improvements, exoskeletons today remain confined
              to the laboratory. To achieve widespread adoption, exoskeletons
              must not only exceed the efficiency of human walking, but also
              provide a perceivable benefit to their wearers. METHODS: In this
              study, we quantify the perceptual threshold of the metabolic
              efficiency benefit provided during exoskeleton-assisted
              locomotion. Ten participants wore bilateral ankle exoskeletons
              during continuous walking. The assistance provided by the
              exoskeletons was varied in 2 min intervals while participants
              provided feedback on their metabolic rate. These data were
              aggregated and used to estimate the perceptual threshold.
              RESULTS: Participants were able to detect a change in their
              metabolic rate of 22.7\% (SD: 17.0\%) with 75\% accuracy. This
              indicates that in the short term and on average, wearers cannot
              yet reliably perceive the metabolic benefits of today's
              augmentative exoskeletons. CONCLUSIONS: If wearers cannot
              perceive the benefits provided by these technologies, it will
              negatively affect their impact, including long-term adoption and
              product viability. Future exoskeleton researchers and designers
