% summary here! BLUF!

% Strength of EMS could be set by the amplitude of the RP -> is there evidence for a correlation between amplitude and 'strength' of volitional action?

% EEG Signal heavily contaminated by eye movement, maybe a worthwhile thing to build this interaction relying solely on eye tracking information, gaze fixating on the target before moving
