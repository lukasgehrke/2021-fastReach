% summary here! BLUF!

% Outlook Ideas
% - Strength of EMS could be set by the amplitude of the RP -> is there evidence for a correlation between amplitude and 'strength' of volitional action?
%[ - EEG Signal may be contaminated by eye movement, maybe a worthwhile thing to build this interaction relying solely on eye tracking information, gaze fixating on the target before moving]
