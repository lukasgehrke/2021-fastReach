              sparsely connected sources analysis (SCSA), can overcome the
              problem of volume conduction by modeling neural data innovatively
              with the following ingredients: 1) the EEG/MEG is assumed to be a
              linear mixture of correlated sources following a multivariate
              autoregressive (MVAR) model; 2) the demixing is estimated jointly
              with the source MVAR parameters; and 3) overfitting is avoided by
              using the group lasso penalty. This approach allows us to extract
              the appropriate level of crosstalk between the extracted sources
              and, in this manner, we obtain a sparse data-driven model of
              functional connectivity. We demonstrate the usefulness of SCSA

  abstract  = "There has been tremendous advances in our ability to produce
               images of human brain function. Applications of functional brain
               imaging extend from improving our understanding of the basic
               mechanisms of cognitive processes to better characterization of
               pathologies that impair normal function. Magnetoencephalography
               (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) (MEG/EEG) localize neural
               electrical activity using noninvasive measurements of external
               electromagnetic signals. Among the available functional imaging
               techniques, MEG and EEG uniquely have temporal resolutions below
               100 ms. This temporal precision allows us to explore the timing
               of basic neural processes at the level of cell assemblies.
               MEG/EEG source localization draws on a wide range of signal
               processing techniques including digital filtering,
               three-dimensional image analysis, array signal processing, image
               modeling and reconstruction, and, blind source separation and
               phase synchrony estimation. We describe the underlying models
               currently used in MEG/EEG source estimation and describe the
               various signal processing steps required to compute these
               sources. In particular we describe methods for computing the

  abstract  = "The objective of this study was to characterize normal
               temporal-spatial patterns during the Reach \& Grasp Cycle and to
               identify upper limb motor deficits in children with cerebral
               palsy (CP). The Reach \& Grasp Cycle encompasses six sequential
               tasks: reach, grasp cylinder, transport to self (T(1)),
               transport back to table (T(2)), release cylinder, and return to
               initial position. Three-dimensional motion data were recorded
               from 25 typically developing children (11 males, 14 females;
               ages 5-18 years) and 12 children with hemiplegic CP (2 males, 10
               females; ages 5-17 years). Within-day and between-day
               coefficients of variation for the control group ranged from 0 to
               0.19, indicating good repeatability of all parameters. The mean
               duration of the Cycle for children with CP was nearly twice as
               long as controls, 9.5$\pm$4.3s versus 5.1$\pm$1.2s (U=37.0,
               P=.002), partly due to prolonged grasp and release durations.
               Peak hand velocity occurred at approximately 40\% of each phase
               and was greater during the transport (T(1), T(2)) than
               non-transport phases (reach, return) in controls (P<.001). Index
               of curvature was lower during transport versus non-transport
               phases for all children. Children with CP demonstrated an
               increased index of curvature during reach (U=46.0, P=.0074) and
               an increased total number of movement units (U=16.5, P<.0001)
               compared to controls, indicating less efficient and less smooth
               movements. Total duration of the Reach \& Grasp Cycle (rho=.957,
               P<.0001), index of curvature during reach and T(1) (rho=.873,
               P=.0002 and rho=.778, P=.0028), and total number of movement
               units (rho=.907, P<.0001) correlated strongly with MACS score.
               The consistent normative data and the substantial differences
               between children with CP and controls reflect utility of the
               Reach \& Grasp Cycle for quantitative evaluation of upper limb

               the Grimme's approach in which new parameters for Pb and O atoms

                   taxonomies used for classifying motions. Fourth, we review
                   various processes involved in motion analysis. Fifth, we

              motion-related interoceptive representations (proprioceptive,

              representations to form a single multimodal representation

              visual input from motion-related interoception by manipulating
              the rotation or translation gain of the visual projection. First,
              participants walked an outbound path with both visual and
              interoceptive input, and returned to the start in darkness,
              demonstrating the influences of both visual and interoceptive

              adapted to visual rotation gains in the virtual environment, and
              then performed the path integration task entirely in darkness.
              Our findings were accurately predicted by a quantitative model in
              which visual and interoceptive inputs combine into a single
              multimodal representation guiding navigation, and are
              incompatible with a model of separate visual and interoceptive
              influences on action (in which path integration in darkness must

                   In machine learning, however, artificial neural networks
                   tend to eschew precisely designed codes, dynamics or
                   circuits in favor of brute force optimization of a cost
                   function, often using simple and relatively uniform initial
                   architectures. Two recent developments have emerged within
                   machine learning that create an opportunity to connect these
                   seemingly divergent perspectives. First, structured
                   architectures are used, including dedicated systems for
                   attention, recursion and various forms of short- and
                   long-term memory storage. Second, cost functions and
                   training procedures have become more complex and are varied
                   across layers and over time. Here we think about the brain
                   in terms of these ideas. We hypothesize that (1) the brain
                   optimizes cost functions, (2) these cost functions are
                   diverse and differ across brain locations and over

                   pre-structured architecture matched to the computational
                   problems posed by behavior. Such a heterogeneously optimized
                   system, enabled by a series of interacting cost functions,
                   serves to make learning data-efficient and precisely

              tests against group-level null hypotheses. A common approach is
              to summarize subject-level data by a single quantity per subject,

                   of network neuroscience, two yet unresolved challenges are
                   potential breakthroughs. First, functional brain networks
                   should be estimated from noninvasive and easy to use
                   neuroimaging techniques. Second, the time/space resolution
                   of these techniques should be high enough to assess the
                   dynamics of identified networks. Emerging evidence suggests
                   that Electroencephalography (EEG) source connectivity method
                   may offer solutions to both issues provided that scalp EEG
                   signals are appropriately processed. Therefore, the
                   performance of EEG source connectivity method strongly
                   depends on signal processing (SP) that involves various
                   methods such as preprocessing techniques, inverse solutions,
                   statistical couplings between signals and network science.

                   such behaviors, it is necessary to select and sequence them
                   to achieve a given task. In this paper, we present an
                   approach to both learn and sequence robot behaviors, applied
                   to the problem of visual navigation of mobile robots. We
                   construct a layered representation of control policies
                   composed of low- level behaviors and a meta-level policy.
                   The low-level behaviors enable the robot to locomote in a
                   particular environment while avoiding obstacles, and the
                   meta-level policy actively selects the low-level behavior
                   most appropriate for the current situation based purely on
                   visual feedback. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
                   method on three simulated robot navigation tasks: a legged
                   hexapod robot which must successfully traverse varying

              dynamics with high temporal resolution. Although signals recorded
              in parallel by multiple, near-adjacent EEG scalp electrode
              channels are highly-correlated and combine signals from many
              different sources, biological and non-biological, independent
              component analysis (ICA) has been shown to isolate the various
              source generator processes underlying those recordings.
              Independent components (IC) found by ICA decomposition can be
              manually inspected, selected, and interpreted, but doing so
              requires both time and practice as ICs have no order or intrinsic
              interpretations and therefore require further study of their
              properties. Alternatively, sufficiently-accurate automated IC
              classifiers can be used to classify ICs into broad source
              categories, speeding the analysis of EEG studies with many
              subjects and enabling the use of ICA decomposition in

              been proposed recently, this work presents the ICLabel project
              comprised of (1) the ICLabel dataset containing spatiotemporal
              measures for over 200,000 ICs from more than 6000 EEG recordings

              ICLabel classifier, freely available for MATLAB. The ICLabel
              classifier improves upon existing methods in two ways: by
              improving the accuracy of the computed label estimates and by

                   comparing the two approaches on the same discrete-state
                   environments. In this paper, we provide: 1) an accessible
                   overview of the discrete-state formulation of active
                   inference, highlighting natural behaviors in active
                   inference that are generally engineered in RL; 2) an
                   explicit discrete-state comparison between active inference
                   and RL on an OpenAI gym baseline. We begin by providing a

                   particular viewing the various natural behaviors of active
                   inference agents through the lens of RL. We show that by
                   operating in a pure belief-based setting, active inference
                   agents can carry out epistemic exploration, and account for
                   uncertainty about their environment in a Bayes-optimal
                   fashion. Furthermore, we show that the reliance on an
                   explicit reward signal in RL is removed in active inference,
                   where reward can simply be treated as another observation;
                   even in the total absence of rewards, agent behaviors are
                   learned through preference learning. We make these
                   properties explicit by showing two scenarios in which active
                   inference agents can infer behaviors in reward-free
                   environments compared to both Q-learning and Bayesian
                   model-based RL agents; by placing zero prior preferences
                   over rewards and by learning the prior preferences over the
                   observations corresponding to reward. We conclude by noting
                   that this formalism can be applied to more complex settings
                   if appropriate generative models can be formulated. In

                   control of muscle activation and thus motor control.
                   Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) is an established
                   and safe technique for contracting muscles by stimulating
                   the skin above a muscle to induce its contraction. However,
                   an open challenge remains on how to restore motor abilities
                   to human limbs through FES, as the problem of controlling
                   the stimulation is unclear. We are taking a robotics
                   perspective on this problem, by developing robot learning
                   algorithms that control the ultimate humanoid robot, the
                   human body, through electrical muscle stimulation. Human
                   muscles are not trivial to control as actuators due to their
                   force production being non-stationary as a result of fatigue
                   and other internal state changes, in contrast to robot
                   actuators which are well-understood and stationary over
                   broad operation ranges. We present our Deep Reinforcement
                   Learning approach to the control of human muscles with FES,
                   using a recurrent neural network for dynamic state
                   representation, to overcome the unobserved elements of the
                   behaviour of human muscles under external stimulation. We
                   demonstrate our technique both in neuromuscular simulations
                   but also experimentally on a human. Our results show that
                   our controller can learn to manipulate human muscles,
                   applying appropriate levels of stimulation to achieve the
                   given tasks while compensating for advancing muscle fatigue
                   which arises throughout the tasks. Additionally, our
                   technique can learn quickly enough to be implemented in
                   real-world human-in-the-loop settings.",

                   one or more robotic haptic proxies to influence user

                   need to be overcome when implementing active haptic

                   increasingly integrated with other rehabilitation devices,
                   including robots. FES cycling is one of the common FES
                   applications in rehabilitation, which is performed by
                   stimulating leg muscles in a certain pattern. The
                   appropriate pattern varies across individuals and requires
                   manual tuning which can be time-consuming and challenging
                   for the individual user. Here, we present an AI-based method
                   for finding the patterns, which requires no extra hardware
                   or sensors. Our method has two phases, starting with finding
                   model-based patterns using reinforcement learning and
                   detailed musculoskeletal models. The models, built using
                   open-source software, can be customised through our
                   automated script and can be therefore used by non-technical
                   individuals without extra cost. Next, our method fine-tunes
                   the pattern using real cycling data. We test our both in
                   simulation and experimentally on a stationary tricycle. In
                   the simulation test, our method can robustly deliver
                   model-based patterns for different cycling configurations.
                   The experimental evaluation shows that our method can find a
                   model-based pattern that induces higher cycling speed than
                   an EMG-based pattern. By using just 100 seconds of cycling
                   data, our method can deliver a fine-tuned pattern that gives
                   better cycling performance. Beyond FES cycling, this work is
                   a showcase, displaying the feasibility and potential of

              single-blinded randomized controlled trial recruited 70 patients
              with gingivitis or mild to moderate chronic periodontitis. All
              the patients received the same professional oral hygiene

              base of conventional oral hygiene, and control group with
              conventional oral hygiene only, were assigned randomly at
              baseline. Then periodontal parameters including Plaque index

              (Ta), thickness of tongue coating (Tt), were measured at baseline
              and two-weeks after. RESULTS: After two weeks, all the
              periodontal parameters except for SI were significantly improved
              within each group (P<0.001). As compared to those in control
              group, the patients in tested group only exhibited significant
              improvement of PlI after two-week-use of oral rinse of Turkish

               hippocampus and its afferent and efferent structures in rodent
               navigation. Our proposal is compatible with the behavioral,
               neurophysiological, anatomical, and neuropharmacological
               literature, and suggests a number of practical experiments that
               could support or refute it. We begin with a review of place
               cells and how the place code for an environment might be aligned
               with sensory cues and updated by self-motion information. The
               existence of place fields in the dark suggests that location
               information is maintained by path integration, which requires an
               internal representation of direction of motion. This leads to a
               consideration of the organization of the rodent head direction
               system, and thence into a discussion of the computational
               structure and anatomical locus of the path integrator. If the
               place code is used in navigation, there must be a mechanism for
               selecting an action based on this information. We review
               evidence that the nucleus accumbens subserves this function.
               From there, we move to interactions between the hippocampal
               system and the environment, emphasizing mechanisms for learning
               novel environments and for aligning the various subsystems upon

  abstract = "This paper presents a model of how hippocampal place cells might
              be used for spatial navigation in two watermaze tasks: the
              standard reference memory task and a delayed matching-to-place
              task. In the reference memory task, the escape platform occupies
              a single location and rats gradually learn relatively direct
              paths to the goal over the course of days, in each of which they
              perform a fixed number of trials. In the delayed
              matching-to-place task, the escape platform occupies a novel
              location on each day, and rats gradually acquire one-trial
              learning, i.e., direct paths on the second trial of each day. The
              model uses a local, incremental, and statistically efficient
              connectionist algorithm called temporal difference learning in
              two distinct components. The first is a reinforcement-based
              ``actor-critic'' network that is a general model of classical and
              instrumental conditioning. In this case, it is applied to
              navigation, using place cells to provide information about state.
              By itself, the actor-critic can learn the reference memory task,
              but this learning is inflexible to changes to the platform
              location. We argue that one-trial learning in the delayed
              matching-to-place task demands a goal-independent representation
              of space. This is provided by the second component of the model:
              a network that uses temporal difference learning and self-motion
              information to acquire consistent spatial coordinates in the
              environment. Each component of the model is necessary at a
              different stage of the task; the actor-critic provides a way of
              transferring control to the component that performs best. The
              model successfully captures gradual acquisition in both tasks,
              and, in particular, the ultimate development of one-trial
              learning in the delayed matching-to-place task. Place cells
              report a form of stable, allocentric information that is
              well-suited to the various kinds of learning in the model.",

              atlas-derived labels from an expert group using a subset of these

              to greater than 90\% within a search range of +/-5 mm for most

              with juvenile dermatomyositis [DM], 30 with juvenile polymyositis
              [PM], and 46 with juvenile connective tissue disease-associated
              myositis [CTM]) enrolled in nationwide protocols. Standardized
              mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated using US population
              statistics. Cox regression analysis was used to assess
              univariable associations with mortality, and random survival
              forest (RSF) classification and Cox regression analysis were used
              for multivariable associations. RESULTS: Of 17 deaths (4.2\%
              overall mortality), 8 (2.4\%) were in juvenile DM patients. Death
              was related to the pulmonary system (primarily interstitial lung
              disease [ILD]) in 7 patients, gastrointestinal system in 3, and
              multisystem in 3, and of unknown etiology in 4 patients. The SMR
              for juvenile IIMs overall was 14.4 (95\% confidence interval
              [95\% CI] 12.2-16.5) and was 8.3 (95\% CI 6.4-10.3) for juvenile
              DM. The top mortality risk factors in the univariable analysis
              included clinical subgroup (juvenile CTM, juvenile PM),
              antisynthetase autoantibodies, older age at diagnosis, ILD, and
              Raynaud's phenomenon at diagnosis. In multivariable analyses,
              clinical subgroup, illness severity at onset, age at diagnosis,
              weight loss, and delay to diagnosis were the most important
              predictors from RSF; clinical subgroup and illness severity at
              onset were confirmed by multivariable Cox regression analysis.
              CONCLUSION: Overall mortality was higher in juvenile IIM
              patients, and several early illness features were identified as
              risk factors. Clinical subgroup, antisynthetase autoantibodies,
              older age at diagnosis, and ILD are also recognized as mortality
              risk factors in adult myositis.",

              recordings of neuronal activity from the human basal ganglia. In
              Parkinson's disease, a disease-specific physiomarker was
              identified that is now used to investigate adaptive closed-loop
              stimulation in first studies. In dystonia, such a physiomarker is
              missing. METHODS: Pallidal oscillations were recorded from 153
              contact pairs in 27 patients. We investigated whether power
              amplitudes in theta and beta bands correlate with dystonic
              symptom severity across patients. We then projected theta power
              from each contact pair onto standard subcortical anatomy. In this
              way, we defined a theta hot spot on a group level and
              investigated whether proximity of the active DBS contacts to it
              correlated with clinical improvement. RESULTS: Dystonic symptom
              severity significantly correlated with theta but not beta
              oscillatory amplitudes ($\rho$ = 0.4, p = 0.009) and
              interhemispheric coherence ($\rho$ = 0.5, p = 0.002). The sweet
              spot of theta activity localized to the posterior third of the
              internal pallidum and theta power correlated with proximity to
              this location ($\rho$ = 0.23, p = 0.002), which coincided with 3
              previously published coordinates describing optimal stimulation
              targets. Finally, motor improvement through pallidal long-term
              DBS correlated with theta peak amplitude ($\rho$ = 0.38, p =
              0.018). INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that theta
              oscillations in the internal pallidum are robustly associated
              with dystonic symptoms in cervical dystonia and may be a useful
              biomarker for adaptive closed-loop stimulation. Furthermore,
              theta oscillatory activity may have a predictive value for the
              clinical benefit after chronic DBS that could be used to improve

  abstract  = "Decision researchers frequently analyze attention to individual
               objects to test hypotheses about underlying cognitive processes.
               Generally, fixations are assigned to objects using a method
               known as area of interest (AOI). Ideally, an AOI includes all
               fixations belonging to an object while fixations to other
               objects are excluded. Unfortunately, due to measurement
               inaccuracy and insufficient distance between objects, the
               distributions of fixations to objects may overlap, resulting in
               a signal detection problem. If the AOI is to include all
               fixations to an object, it will also likely include fixations
               belonging to other objects (false positives). In a survey, we
               find that many researchers report testing multiple AOI sizes
               when performing analyses, presumably trying to balance the
               proportion of true and false positive fixations. To test whether
               AOI size influences the measurement of object attention and
               conclusions drawn about cognitive processes, we reanalyze four
               published studies and conduct a fifth tailored to our purpose.
               We find that in studies in which we expected overlapping
               fixation distributions, analyses benefited from smaller AOI
               sizes (0° visual angle margin). In studies where we expected no
               overlap, analyses benefited from larger AOI sizes (>.5° visual
               angle margins). We conclude with a guideline for the use of AOIs

              standardized and objective measures of the sense of presence have
              been difficult to find. Studies attempting to find physiological
              correlates of sense presence using electroencephalography (EEG)
              have reported mixed results. In the present study, we used brain
              event-related potentials (ERPs) elicited by auditory stimuli to
              identify an objective physiological index of sense of presence
              during VR, attempting to replicate the findings of previous
              studies and explain the heterogeneity of results reported in the
              literature. Participants in our experiment were asked to
              experience an immersive virtual environment using a modern
              head-mounted display while passively hearing task-irrelevant
              frequent standard and infrequent deviant tones as in a classic
              auditory oddball paradigm. Subsequently, they were asked to
              complete a battery of questionnaires aimed to estimate their
              sense of presence during the VR. EEG and questionnaire data from
              three-seventh participants were analyzed. ERP components evoked

              (after 450 ms from stimulus onset) registered over central brain
              areas were associated with the sense of presence as measured with
              questionnaires, while earlier components were not associated with
              presence. The use of different questionnaires and the content of
              the VR environment may both be a plausible explanation for
              heterogeneous results as reported in previous studies. The

  abstract = "Holes in the skull may have a large influence on the EEG and ERP.
              Inverse source modeling techniques such as dipole fitting require
              an accurate volume conductor model. This model should incorporate
              holes if present, especially when either a neuronal generator or
              the electrodes are close to the hole, e.g., in case of a trephine
              hole in the upper part of the skull. The boundary element method
              (BEM) is at present the preferred method for inverse computations
              using a realistic head model, because of its efficiency and
              availability. Using a simulation approach, we have studied the
              accuracy of the BEM by comparing it to the analytical solution
              for a volume conductor without a hole, and to the finite
              difference method (FDM) for one with a hole. Furthermore, we have
              evaluated the influence of holes on the results of forward and
              inverse computations using the BEM. Without a hole and compared
              to the analytical model, a three-sphere BEM model was accurate up
              to 5-10\%, while the corresponding FDM model had an error <0.5\%.
              In the presence of a hole, the difference between the BEM and the
              FDM was, on average, 4\% (1.3-11.4\%). The FDM turned out to be
              very accurate if no hole is present. We believe that the
              difference between the BEM and the FDM represents the inaccuracy
              of the BEM. This inaccuracy in the BEM is very small compared to
              the effect that holes can have on the scalp potential (up to
              450\%). In regard to the large influence of holes on forward and
              inverse computations, we conclude that holes in the skull can be
              treated reliably by means of the BEM and should be incorporated
              in forward and inverse modeling.",

  abstract = "We describe a method for using a generic head model, in the form
              of an anatomical atlas, to produce EEG source localizations. The
              atlas is fitted to the subject by a nonrigid warp using a set of
              surface landmarks. The warped atlas is used to compute a finite
              element model (FEM) of the forward mapping or lead-fields between
              neural current generators and the EEG electrodes. These
              lead-fields are used to localize current sources from the
              subject's EEG data and the sources are then mapped back to the
              anatomical atlas. This approach provides a mechanism for
              comparing source localizations across subjects in an atlas-based
              coordinate system, which can be used in the large fraction of EEG
              studies in which MR images are not available. The Montreal brain
              atlas was used as the reference anatomical atlas and 10
              individual MR volumes were used to evaluate the method. The atlas
              was fitted to each subject's head by a thin-plate-spline (TPS)
              warp. The spatial locations of a generic 155-electrode
              configuration were used to constrain the warp. For the purposes
              of evaluation, dipolar sources were placed on the inner cortical
              surface in the atlas geometry and transferred to each subject's
              brain space using a polynomial warp. The parameters of the warp
              were computed using an intensity-based matching of the atlas and
              subject brains, thus ensuring that the sources were placed at
              approximately the same anatomical location in each case. Data
              were simulated in the subject geometry and a dipole fit was
              performed on these data using an FEM of the TPS warped atlas. The
              source positions found in the warped atlas were transferred back
              to the original atlas and compared to the original position.
              Sources were simulated at 972 locations evenly distributed over
              the inner cortical surface of the atlas. The mean error over all
              10 subjects was 8.1 mm in the subject space and 15.2 mm in the
              atlas space. In comparison, using an affine transformation of the
              electrodes into atlas space and an FEM model generated from the
              atlas produced mean errors of 22.3 mm in subject space and 19.6
              mm in atlas space. With a standard three-shell spherical model

  abstract = "Interactions between functionally specialized brain regions are
              crucial for normal brain function. Magnetoencephalography (MEG)
              and electroencephalography (EEG) are techniques suited to capture
              these interactions, because they provide whole head measurements
              of brain activity in the millisecond range. More than one sensor
              picks up the activity of an underlying source. This field spread
              severely limits the utility of connectivity measures computed
              directly between sensor recordings. Consequentially, neuronal
              interactions should be studied on the level of the reconstructed
              sources. This article reviews several methods that have been
              applied to investigate interactions between brain regions in

              to quantify connectivity, and on the different strategies adopted

              accounts of MEG and EEG source connectivity, caution with respect
              to the interpretation of the results is still warranted. This is
              due to the fact that effects of field spread can never be

              exciting and developing field of research this cautionary note

              networks'' (RSNs). Although independent component analysis (ICA)
              in fMRI studies has elucidated synchronous spatiotemporal
              patterns during cognitive tasks, less is known about the changes
              in EEG functional connectivity between eyes closed (EC) and eyes
              open (EO) states, two traditionally used baseline indices. Here
              we investigated healthy subjects (n = 27) in EC and EO employing
              a four-step analytic approach to the EEG: (1) group ICA to
              extract independent components (ICs), (2) standardized
              low-resolution tomography analysis (sLORETA) for cortical source
              localization of IC network nodes, followed by (3) graph theory
              for functional connectivity estimation of epochwise IC
              band-power, and (4) circumscribing IC similarity measures via
              hierarchical cluster analysis and multidimensional scaling (MDS).
              Our proof-of-concept results on alpha-band power demonstrate five
              statistically clustered groups with frontal, central, parietal,
              occipitotemporal, and occipital sources. Importantly, during EO
              compared with EC, graph analyses revealed two salient functional
              networks with frontoparietal connectivity: a more medial network
              with nodes in the mPFC/precuneus which overlaps with the
              ``default-mode network'' (DMN), and a more lateralized network
              comprising the middle frontal gyrus and inferior parietal lobule,
              coinciding with the ``dorsal attention network'' (DAN).
              Furthermore, a separate MDS analysis of ICs supported the
              emergence of a pattern of increased proximity (shared
              information) between frontal and parietal clusters specifically
              for the EO state. We propose that the disclosed component groups
              and their source-derived EEG functional connectivity maps may be
              a valuable method for elucidating direct neuronal

  abstract = "Relating behavioral and neuroimaging measures is essential to
              understanding human brain function. Often, this is achieved by
              computing a correlation between behavioral measures, e.g.,
              reaction times, and neurophysiological recordings, e.g.,
              prestimulus EEG alpha-power, on a single-trial-basis. This
              approach treats individual trials as independent measurements and
              ignores the fact that data are acquired in a temporal order. It
              has already been shown that behavioral measures as well as
              neurophysiological recordings display power-law dynamics, which
              implies that trials are not in fact independent. Critically,
              computing the correlation coefficient between two measures
              exhibiting long-range temporal dependencies may introduce
              spurious correlations, thus leading to erroneous conclusions
              about the relationship between brain activity and behavioral
              measures. Here, we address data-analytic pitfalls which may arise
              when long-range temporal dependencies in neural as well as
              behavioral measures are ignored. We quantify the influence of
              temporal dependencies of neural and behavioral measures on the
              observed correlations through simulations. Results are further
              supported in analysis of real EEG data recorded in a simple

              responses on the basis of prestimulus alpha oscillations. We show
              that it is possible to ``predict'' reaction times from one
              subject on the basis of EEG activity recorded in another subject
              simply owing to the fact that both measures display power-law
              dynamics. The same is true when correlating EEG activity obtained
              from different subjects. A surrogate-data procedure is described

              by examining the basic building blocks of path integration in
              humans. To achieve this goal, we used functional imaging to
              examine the neural mechanisms that support the tracking and
              memory of translational and rotational components of human path
              integration. Critically, and in contrast to previous studies, we
              examined movement in translation and rotation tasks with no
              defined end-point or goal. Navigators accumulated translational
              and rotational information during virtual self-motion. Activity
              in hippocampus, retrosplenial cortex (RSC), and parahippocampal
              cortex (PHC) increased during both translation and rotation
              encoding, suggesting that these regions track self-motion
              information during path integration. These results address
              current questions regarding distance coding in the human brain.
              By implementing a modified delayed match to sample paradigm, we
              also examined the encoding and maintenance of path integration

              gyrus, including the supplementary motor area (SMA) and inferior
              frontal areas, is important. There is an ongoing debate about the
              functional roles of these structures during response inhibition
              as it is unclear whether these structures process different codes
              or contents of information during response inhibition. In the
              current study, we examined this question with a focus on theta
              frequency oscillations during response inhibition processes. We
              used a standard Go/Nogo task in a sample of human participants
              and combined different EEG signal decomposition methods with EEG
              beamforming approaches. The results suggest that stimulus coding
              during inhibitory control is attained by oscillations in the
              upper theta frequency band (∼7 Hz). In contrast, response
              selection codes during inhibitory control appear to be attained
              by the lower theta frequency band (∼4 Hz). Importantly, these
              different codes seem to be processed in distinct functional
              neuroanatomical structures. Although the SMA may process stimulus
              codes and response selection codes, the inferior frontal cortex
              may selectively process response selection codes during
              inhibitory control. Taken together, the results suggest that

              associated with response inhibition mechanisms process different
              kinds of codes during inhibitory control. These codes seem to be

              We programmed a video game with distorted kinematic and dynamic

              can acquire motor modules in a separated or integrated manner.
              However, the system appears to require integrated practice to
              coordinate the adaptations with the skill learning and the
              networks involved in the integrated behavior. This integration

              only when the animal occupies that cell's ``place field,'' a

              (HD) cells encode directional heading, with each HD cell firing
              when the rat's head is oriented in that cell's particular

              oscillations provide a useful insight into the relationship among
              these terms. In rats trained to run in direction-guided
              (1-dimensional) tasks, hippocampal cell assemblies discharge
              sequentially, with different assemblies active on opposite runs,
              i.e., place cells are unidirectional. Such tasks do not require
              map representation and are formally identical with learning
              sequentially occurring items in an episode. Hebbian plasticity,
              acting within the temporal window of the theta cycle, converts
              the travel distances into synaptic strengths between the
              sequentially activated and unidirectionally connected assemblies.
              In contrast, place representations by hippocampal neurons in
              2-dimensional environments are typically omnidirectional,
              characteristic of a map. Generation of a map requires
              exploration, essentially a dead reckoning behavior. We suggest
              that omnidirectional navigation through the same places
              (junctions) during exploration gives rise to omnidirectional
              place cells and, consequently, maps free of temporal context.
              Analogously, multiple crossings of common junction(s) of episodes
              convert the common junction(s) into context-free or semantic
              memory. Theta oscillation can hence be conceived as the
              navigation rhythm through both physical and mnemonic space,
              facilitating the formation of maps and episodic/semantic
              memories.",

              their environment to guide spatial navigation has a long and
              controversial history. One reason for this enduring controversy
              might be that individuals vary considerably in their ability to
              form and utilize cognitive maps. Here we investigate the
              behavioral and neuroanatomical signatures of these individual
              differences. Participants learned an unfamiliar campus
              environment over a period of three weeks. In their first visit,
              they learned the position of different buildings along two routes
              in separate areas of the campus. During the following weeks, they
              learned these routes for a second and third time, along with two
              paths that connected both areas of the campus. Behavioral
              assessments after each learning session indicated that subjects
              formed a coherent representation of the spatial structure of the
              entire campus after learning a single connecting path. Volumetric
              analyses of structural MRI data and voxel-based morphometry (VBM)
              indicated that the size of the right posterior hippocampus
              predicted the ability to use this spatial knowledge to make
              inferences about the relative positions of different buildings on
              the campus. An inverse relationship between gray matter volume
              and performance was observed in the caudate. These results

              hypothesized that the PPC also engages other cognitive processes
              in the transformation of behaviorally relevant visual inputs into
              appropriate actions, for example, monitoring of multiple
              locations, selection of responses to locations in space, and
              monitoring the outcome of response selections. We recorded single
              cells and local field potentials in the rat PPC during
              performance on a novel visuospatial attention (VSA) task that
              requires visually monitoring locations in space in order to make
              appropriate stimulus-guided locomotor responses. In each trial,
              rats attended to four locations on the floor of a maze. A
              randomly chosen location was briefly illuminated. Approach to the
              correct target location was followed by food reward. We observed
              that PPC activity correlated with multiple phases of the VSA
              task, including monitoring for stimulus onset, detection of a
              target, spatial location of the target, and target choice. A
              substantial proportion of cells with behavioral correlates were
              also modulated by outcome of the trial. Our analyses of local
              field potentials revealed strong oscillatory rhythms in the theta
              frequency band, and more than a third of PPC neurons were phase
              locked to theta oscillations. As in other brain regions, theta
              power correlated with running speed. Peak theta power was higher

              volume conduction from the hippocampus. In addition, theta power

              significantly higher following incorrect choices compared with
              correct choices, possibly providing a prediction error signal.

              Twenty obese subjects were imaged on a Philips Achieva 1.5T
              scanner by a fast spin-echo (FSE) sequence. A total of 636 images

              Muscle and intermuscular adipose tissue (IMAT) were assessed by
              identifying the two peaks of the signal histogram with an

              inducing systematic changes of WV. Backward flow caused a
              decrease and forward flow an increase of WV. Without effect of
              rOF, PD patients on average walked at 0.89 meters per second

               rate that maximizes the Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC)
               and F1 score assuming normality. We showed that adjusting the
               size of each class to be equal is not always the best solution.
               Instead, we found that there exists the optimal rate depending
               on the level of class imbalance and the Mahalanobis distance
               between two classes. Conducting extensive simulation studies and
               real data analyses, we confirmed that rebalancing with the
               optimal rate improves the test MCC and F1 score. These findings
               suggest that with a careful consideration on the level of class
               imbalance and the separability between two classes, we can
               achieve better classification results in presence of class
               imbalance.",

  abstract = "We used fMRI to examine the neural response in frontal and
              parietal cortices associated with viewing and naming pictures of
              different categories of objects. Because tools are commonly
              associated with specific hand movements, we predicted that
              pictures of tools, but not other categories of objects, would
              elicit activity in regions of the brain that store information
              about motor-based properties. We found that viewing and naming
              pictures of tools selectively activated the left ventral premotor
              cortex (BA 6). Single-unit recording studies in monkeys have
              shown that neurons in the rostral part of the ventral premotor
              cortex (canonical F5 neurons) respond to the visual presentation
              of graspable objects, even in the absence of any subsequent motor
              activity. Thus, the left ventral premotor region that responded
              selectively to tools in the current study may be the human
              homolog of the monkey canonical F5 area. Viewing and naming tools
              also selectively activated the left posterior parietal cortex (BA
              40). This response is similar to the firing of monkey anterior
              intraparietal neurons to the visual presentation of graspable
              objects. In humans and monkeys, there appears to be a close link
              between manipulable objects and information about the actions
              associated with their use. The selective activation of the left
              posterior parietal and left ventral premotor cortices by pictures
              of tools suggests that the ability to recognize and identify at
              least one category of objects (tools) may depend on activity in
              specific sites of the ventral and dorsal visual processing
              streams.",

               disadvantages, hinders mass production and, in parallel, the
               materials used do not achieve the required maximum performance.
               It is known also that there are a reasonable number of
               pathologies associated with the foot which implies the
               production of specialized insoles. In this dissertation, involve

               circumvent some of these problems. These resulted from a mixture
               of two base resins, EVA/HDPE, and using compression molding. In
               the first phase a reasonable amount of preselected formulations
               were produced and characterized. In the second phase we selected
               the best formulation found in the previous step and the
               parameters of the manufacturing process were adjusted in order
               to improve the produced foam properties. Simultaneously a new
               mold was designed, machined and tested aiming to achieve some
               improvements on the produced foams. Finally, a proposal for
               industrialization of the insoles manufacturing process was
               established, which faces the limitations associated with
               currently employed method. The tests performed during the
               preliminary studies showed that the produced formulation
               properties were below the ones of the foam used as a reference,
               Poron, the most problematic was the permeability to water vapor.
               On the second phase of the study changes in the processing of
               foams were implemented and the produced foam blocks were
               drilled. The results were in general positive conclusion is
               therefore that the introduction of the drilling step was a

               was presented for the industrialization of the insoles
               manufacturing process. This proposal consists of the sequence of
               operations to be used in the production of insoles, based on the

               self-movement. Navigation by active movement through space
               combines multisensory perception with internally generated
               self-motion cues. We investigated the spatial microgenesis
               during free ambulatory exploration of interactive sparse virtual
               environments using motion capture synchronized to high
               resolution electroencephalographic (EEG) data as well AS
               psychometric and self-report measures. In such environments,

               transient, egocentric first-person perspective 3-D spatial
               information. Considering individual differences of spatial
               learning ability, we studied if changes in exploration behavior
               coincide with spatial learning of an environment. To this end,
               we analyzed the quality of sketch maps (a description of spatial
               learning) that were produced after repeated learning trials for
               differently complex maze environments. We observed significant

               last exploration of a maze: a decrease in time spent in the maze
               predicted an increase in subsequent sketch map quality.
               Furthermore, individual differences in spatial abilities as well
               as differences in the level of experienced immersion had an
               impact on the quality of spatial learning. Our results

               transparency of the tools and equipment through which we sense
               and manipulate the world. This is a claim that may be traced to
               phenomenological philosophers such as Heidegger and
               Merleau-Ponty, but it has been influential in user interface
               design where the transparency of technology has often been
               adopted as a mark of good design. Moreover, in the philosophy of
               cognitive science, such transparency has been advanced as
               necessary for extended cognition (the situation in which the
               technology with which we couple genuinely counts as a
               constitutive part of our cognitive machinery, along with our
               brains). By reflecting on concrete examples of our contemporary

               challenges posed by smart artefacts (those that come equipped

               reassessment of the drive for transparency in the design of some

  abstract = "The study of patients to infer normal brain function has a long
              tradition in neurology and psychology. More recently, the motor
              system has been subject to quantitative and computational
              characterization. The purpose of this review is to argue that the
              lesion approach and theoretical motor control can mutually inform
              each other. Specifically, one may identify distinct motor control
              processes from computational models and map them onto specific
              deficits in patients. Here we review some of the impairments in
              motor control, motor learning and higher-order motor control in
              patients with lesions of the corticospinal tract, the cerebellum,
              parietal cortex, the basal ganglia, and the medial temporal lobe.
              We attempt to explain some of these impairments in terms of
              computational ideas such as state estimation, optimization,
              prediction, cost, and reward. We suggest that a function of the
              cerebellum is system identification: to build internal models
              that predict sensory outcome of motor commands and correct motor
              commands through internal feedback. A function of the parietal
              cortex is state estimation: to integrate the predicted
              proprioceptive and visual outcomes with sensory feedback to form
              a belief about how the commands affected the states of the body
              and the environment. A function of basal ganglia is related to
              optimal control: learning costs and rewards associated with
              sensory states and estimating the ``cost-to-go'' during execution
              of a motor task. Finally, functions of the primary and the
              premotor cortices are related to implementing the optimal control

  abstract = "Many previous studies have focused on how humans combine inputs
              provided by different modalities for the same physical property.
              However, it is not yet very clear how different senses providing
              information about our own movements combine in order to provide a
              motion percept. We designed an experiment to investigate how
              upright turns are stored, and particularly how vestibular and
              visual cues interact at the different stages of the memorization
              process (encoding/recalling). Subjects experienced passive yaw
              turns stimulated in the vestibular modality (whole-body
              rotations) and/or in the visual modality (limited lifetime
              star-field rotations), with the visual scene turning 1.5 times
              faster when combined (unnoticed conflict). Then they were asked
              to actively reproduce the rotation displacement in the opposite
              direction, with body cues only, visual cues only, or both cues
              with either the same or a different gain factor. First, we found
              that in none of the conditions did the reproduced motion dynamics
              follow that of the presentation phase (Gaussian angular velocity
              profiles). Second, the unimodal recalling of turns was largely
              uninfluenced by the other sensory cue that it could be combined
              with during the encoding. Therefore, turns in each modality,
              visual, and vestibular are stored independently. Third, when the
              intersensory gain was preserved, the bimodal reproduction was
              more precise (reduced variance) and lay between the two unimodal
              reproductions. This suggests that with both visual and vestibular
              cues available, these combine in order to improve the
              reproduction. Fourth, when the intersensory gain was modified,
              the bimodal reproduction resulted in a substantially larger
              change for the body than for the visual scene rotations, which
              indicates that vision prevails for this rotation displacement

              continuous, real-time estimate of perceived position, observers
              were asked to continuously point toward a previously viewed
              target in the absence of vision. They did so while moving on a
              large circular treadmill under various movement conditions. Two
              conditions were designed to evaluate spatial updating when
              information was largely limited to either proprioceptive
              information (walking in place) or vestibular information (passive
              movement). A third condition evaluated updating when both sources
              of information were available (walking through space) and were

              condition and while walking through space, the pattern of

               navigator leaves home on a complex outbound path, they are able
               to keep track of their approximate position and orientation and
               return to their starting location on a direct homebound path.
               However, there are several sources of error during path
               integration. Previous research has focused almost exclusively on
               encoding error-the error in registering the outbound path in
               memory. Here, we also consider execution error-the error in the
               response, such as turning and walking a homebound trajectory. In
               two experiments conducted in ambulatory virtual environments, we
               examined the contribution of execution error to the rotational
               component of path integration using angle reproduction tasks. In
               the reproduction tasks, participants rotated once and then
               rotated again to face the original direction, either reproducing
               the initial turn or turning through the supplementary angle. One
               outstanding difficulty in disentangling encoding and execution
               error during a typical angle reproduction task is that as the
               encoding angle increases, so does the required response angle.
               In Experiment 1, we dissociated these two variables by asking
               participants to report each encoding angle using two different
               responses: by turning to walk on a path parallel to the initial
               facing direction in the same (reproduction) or opposite
               (supplementary angle) direction. In Experiment 2, participants
               reported the encoding angle by turning both rightward and
               leftward onto a path parallel to the initial facing direction,
               over a larger range of angles. The results suggest that
               execution error, not encoding error, is the predominant source
               of error in angular path integration. These findings also imply
               that the path integrator uses an intrinsic (action-scaled)

               these predictions are formed and on which levels of processing

               levels of processing, where visual features are represented

               predictions formed based on full object representations that
               involve combinations of visual features. In four experiments,
               the present study investigated whether the visual system forms
               joint prediction errors or whether expectations about different
               visual features such as color and orientation are formed

              discharge are traditionally considered to serve as predictors of
              self-generated sensory inputs and by interfering with their
              central processing are able to counter unwanted consequences of
              an animal's own actions. Here, in a speculative reflection on
              this issue, we consider a different functional role for such
              intrinsic predictive signaling, namely in stabilizing gaze during
              locomotion where resultant changes in head orientation in space
              require online compensatory eye movements in order to prevent
              retinal image slip. The direct activation of extraocular
              motoneurons by locomotor-related efference copies offers a
              prospective substrate for assisting self-motion derived sensory
              feedback, rather than being subtracted from the sensory signal to
              eliminate unwanted reafferent information. However, implementing
              such a feed-forward mechanism would be critically dependent on an
              appropriate phase coupling between rhythmic propulsive movement
              and resultant head/visual image displacement. We used video
              analyzes of actual locomotor behavior and basic theoretical
              modeling to evaluate head motion during stable locomotion in
              animals as diverse as Xenopus laevis tadpoles, teleost fish and
              horses in order to assess the potential suitability of spinal
              efference copies to the stabilization of gaze during locomotion.
              In all three species, and therefore regardless of aquatic or
              terrestrial environment, the head displacements that accompanied
              locomotor action displayed a strong correlative spatio-temporal
              relationship in correspondence with a potential predictive value
              for compensatory eye adjustments. Although spinal central pattern
              generator-derived efference copies offer appropriately timed
              commands for extraocular motor control during self-generated
              motion, it is likely that precise image stabilization requires
              the additional contributions of sensory feedback signals.
              Nonetheless, the predictability of the visual consequences of
              stereotyped locomotion renders intrinsic efference copy signaling
              an appealing mechanism for offsetting these disturbances, thus
              questioning the exclusive role traditionally ascribed to
              sensory-motor transformations in stabilizing gaze during

  abstract  = "Active inference is an approach to understanding behaviour that
               rests upon the idea that the brain uses an internal generative
               model to predict incoming sensory data. The fit between this
               model and data may be improved in two ways. The brain could
               optimise probabilistic beliefs about the variables in the
               generative model (i.e. perceptual inference). Alternatively, by
               acting on the world, it could change the sensory data, such that
               they are more consistent with the model. This implies a common
               objective function (variational free energy) for action and
               perception that scores the fit between an internal model and the
               world. We compare two free energy functionals for active
               inference in the framework of Markov decision processes. One of
               these is a functional of beliefs (i.e. probability
               distributions) about states and policies, but a function of
               observations, while the second is a functional of beliefs about
               all three. In the former (expected free energy), prior beliefs
               about outcomes are not part of the generative model (because
               they are absorbed into the prior over policies). Conversely, in
               the second (generalised free energy), priors over outcomes
               become an explicit component of the generative model. When using
               the free energy function, which is blind to future observations,
               we equip the generative model with a prior over policies that
               ensure preferred (i.e. priors over) outcomes are realised. In
               other words, if we expect to encounter a particular kind of
               outcome, this lends plausibility to those policies for which
               this outcome is a consequence. In addition, this formulation
               ensures that selected policies minimise uncertainty about future
               outcomes by minimising the free energy expected in the future.
               When using the free energy functional-that effectively treats
               future observations as hidden states-we show that policies are
               inferred or selected that realise prior preferences by
               minimising the free energy of future expectations.
               Interestingly, the form of posterior beliefs about policies (and
               associated belief updating) turns out to be identical under both
               formulations, but the quantities used to compute them are not.",

              understood within an action-oriented approach. Therefore, we
              performed three experiments testing the knowledge of the absolute
              orientation of houses and streets towards north, the relative
              orientation of two houses and two streets, respectively, and the
              location of houses towards each other in a pointing task. Our
              results demonstrate that under time pressure, the relative
              orientation of two houses can be retrieved more accurately than
              the absolute orientation of single houses. With infinite time for
              cognitive reasoning, the performance of the task using house
              stimuli increased greatly for the absolute orientation and

              color-i.e., goal-related prediction error. To investigate
              implicit and explicit components of SoA, we collected indirect

              interaction with a virtual environment. Interaction in the world
              results in spatial and temporal correlation of tactile,

              perceptual inference in sensory cortex, where descending

              locomotion as well as object manipulation and transportation.

              display, monitor) on the sense of agency (SOA). SOA is the
              experience of controlling one's own actions and their
              corresponding effects in the environment. The N = 31 (48\%
              female, with a mean age of 24) participants had to interact
              repeatedly with three different objects (lamp, tablet and
              computer) in a virtual environment (presented on a monitor or via
              a head-mounted display) by using a voice command or pressing a
              button to turn the objects on. The objects reacted after a
              specific technical system response delay (150, 450 and 750 ms).
              Results showed that the SOA was weaker for actions employing
              voice commands opposed to button presses, except for the explicit
              SOA in the monitor condition. Higher latencies diminished the
              explicit, but not the implicit SOA. Neither the explicit nor the
              implicit SOA was significantly affected by the display modality.
              The findings in part support the weighting process of different
              agency cues of the underlying framework, and we propose to extend
              this model by a sense of presence. Users seem to react as if they

              take account of our findings regarding the modality of an action

              planning and execution of movements. 9 healthy volunteers each
              performed 1080 trials of a repetitive reaching task with an
              implicit two-alternative forced choice, i.e., use of the right or
              left hand, in response to the appearance of a visual target. The

              embodied agents, like ourselves, as satisfying basic imperatives
              for sustained exchanges with the environment. In brief, one
              simple driving force appears to explain many aspects of
              perception, action and the perception of action. This driving
              force is the minimisation of surprise or prediction error,
              which--in the context of perception--corresponds to Bayes-optimal
              predictive coding (that suppresses exteroceptive prediction
              errors) and--in the context of action--reduces to classical motor
              reflexes (that suppress proprioceptive prediction errors). In
              what follows, we look at some of the phenomena that emerge from
              this single principle, such as the perceptual encoding of spatial
              trajectories that can both generate movement (of self) and
              recognise the movements (of others). These emergent behaviours

               correspond to distinct cognitive processes. A variety of blind
               source separation (BSS) approaches have been developed and
               implemented within the past few decades, providing an improved
               isolation of these distinct processes. Within the present study,
               we demonstrate the feasibility of multi-subject BSS for deriving
               distinct EEG spatiospectral maps. Multi-subject spatiospectral
               EEG decompositions were implemented using the EEGIFT toolbox (
               http://mialab.mrn.org/software/eegift/ ) with real and realistic
               simulated datasets (the simulation code is available at
               http://mialab.mrn.org/software/simeeg ). Twelve different
               decomposition algorithms were evaluated. Within the simulated
               data, WASOBI and COMBI appeared to be the best performing
               algorithms, as they decomposed the four sources across a range
               of component numbers and noise levels. RADICAL ICA, ERBM,
               INFOMAX ICA, ICA EBM, FAST ICA, and JADE OPAC decomposed a
               subset of sources within a smaller range of component numbers
               and noise levels. INFOMAX ICA, FAST ICA, WASOBI, and COMBI
               generated the largest number of stable sources within the real
               dataset and provided partially distinct views of underlying
               spatiospectral maps. We recommend the multi-subject BSS approach
               and the selected algorithms for further studies examining
               distinct spatiospectral networks within healthy and clinical

  abstract = "A biophysical framework needed to interpret electrophysiological
              data recorded at multiple spatial scales of brain tissue is
              developed. Micro current sources at membrane surfaces produce
              local field potentials, electrocorticography, and
              electroencephalography (EEG). We categorize multi-scale sources
              as genuine, equivalent, or representative. Genuine sources occur
              at the micro scale of cell surfaces. Equivalent sources provide
              identical experimental outcomes over a range of scales and
              applications. In contrast, each representative source
              distribution is just one of many possible source distributions
              that yield similar experimental outcomes. Macro sources
              (``dipoles'') may be defined at the macrocolumn (mm) scale and
              depend on several features of the micro sources-magnitudes, micro
              synchrony within columns, and distribution through the cortical
              depths. These micro source properties are determined by brain
              dynamics and the columnar structure of cortical tissue. The
              number of representative sources underlying EEG data depends on
              the spatial scale of neural tissue under study. EEG inverse
              solutions (e.g. dipole localization) and high resolution
              estimates (e.g. Laplacian, dura imaging) have both strengths and

               based on Kernel Canonical Correlation Analysis (kCCA) that
               computes a multivariate temporal filter which links one data
               modality to another one. The filters can be used to compute a
               multivariate extension of the cross-correlogram, the canonical
               correlogram, between data sources that have different
               dimensionalities and temporal resolutions. The canonical
               correlogram reflects the coupling dynamics between the two
               sources. The temporal filter reveals which features in the data
               give rise to these couplings and when they do so. We present
               results from simulations and neuroscientific experiments showing
               that tkCCA yields easily interpretable temporal filters and
               correlograms. In the experiments, we simultaneously performed

              musical absorption, we together answer the how question by
              pointing to the resource of the qualitative interview. Using the
              qualitative interview is a direct response to Varela's call for
              better pragmatics in the methodology of phenomenology and
              cognitive science and Gallagher's suggestion for phenomenology to
              develop its methodology and outsource its tasks. We agree with
              their proposals, but want to develop them further by discussing
              and proposing a general framework that can integrate research
              paradigms of the well-established disciplines of phenomenological
              philosophy and qualitative science. We give this the working

               arguments, which seek to either extend or oppose various aspects
               of the emerging framework. In particular, the question of how to
               position predictive processing with respect to enactive and
               embodied cognition has become a topic of intense debate. While
               these arguments are certainly of valuable scientific and
               philosophical merit, they risk underestimating the variety of
               approaches gathered under the predictive label. Here, we first
               present a basic review of neuroscientific, cognitive, and
               philosophical approaches to PP, to illustrate how these range
               from solidly cognitivist applications-with a firm commitment to
               modular, internalistic mental representation-to more moderate
               views emphasizing the importance of 'body-representations', and
               finally to those which fit comfortably with radically enactive,
               embodied, and dynamic theories of mind. Any nascent predictive
               processing theory (e.g., of attention or consciousness) must
               take into account this continuum of views, and associated
               theoretical commitments. As a final point, we illustrate how the
               Free Energy Principle (FEP) attempts to dissolve tension between
               internalist and externalist accounts of cognition, by providing
               a formal synthetic account of how internal 'representations'
               arise from autopoietic self-organization. The FEP thus furnishes
               empirically productive process theories (e.g., predictive
               processing) by which to guide discovery through the formal
               modelling of the embodied mind.",

  abstract = "Predictive processing has begun to offer new insights into the
              nature of conscious experience---but the link is not
              straightforward. A wide variety of systems may be described as
              predictive machines, raising the question: what differentiates
              those for which it makes sense to talk about conscious
              experience? One possible answer lies in the involvement of a
              higher-order form of prediction error, termed expected free
              energy. In this paper we explore under what conditions the
              minimization of this new quantity might underpin conscious
              experience. Our suggestion is that the minimisation of Expected
              Free Energy is not in itself sufficient for the occurrence of
              conscious experience. Instead, it is relevant only insofar as it
              helps deliver what Ward et al. (2011) have previously described
              as a sense of our own poise over an action space. Perceptual
              experience, we will argue, is nothing other than the process that
              puts current actions in contact with goals and intentions,
              enabling some creatures to know the space of options that their
              current situation makes available. This proposal fits with recent
              work suggesting a deep link between conscious contents and
              contents computed at an `intermediate' level of processing, apt
              for controlling action.",

              applications through brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) affords
              intriguingly novel ways for humans to engage and interact with
              the world. Not only do BCIs play an important role in restorative
              medicine, they are also increasingly used outside of medical or
              therapeutic contexts (e.g., gaming or mental state monitoring). A
              striking peculiarity of BCI technology is that the kind of
              actions it enables seems to differ from paradigmatic human
              actions, because, effects in the world are brought about by
              devices such as robotic arms, prosthesis, or other machines, and
              their execution runs through a computer directed by brain
              signals. In contrast to usual forms of action, the sequence does
              not need to involve bodily or muscle movements at all. A
              motionless body, the epitome of inaction, might be acting. How do
              theories of action relate to such BCI-mediated forms of changing
              the world? We wish to explore this question through the lenses of
              three perspectives on agency: subjective experience of agency,
              philosophical action theory, and legal concepts of action. Our
              analysis pursues three aims: First, we shall discuss whether and
              which BCI-mediated events qualify as actions, according to the
              main concepts of action in philosophy and law. Secondly, en
              passant, we wish to highlight the ten most interesting novelties
              or peculiarities of BCI-mediated movements. Thirdly, we seek to
              explore whether these novel forms of movement may have
              consequences for concepts of agency. More concretely, we think
              that convincing assessments of BCI-movements require more
              fine-grained accounts of agency and a distinction between various
              forms of control during movements. In addition, we show that the
              disembodied nature of BCI-mediated events causes troubles for the
              standard legal account of actions as bodily movements. In an
              exchange with views from philosophy, we wish to propose that the
              law ought to reform its concept of action to include some, but
              not all, BCI-mediated events and sketch some of the wider
              implications this may have, especially for the venerable legal
              idea of the right to freedom of thought. In this regard, BCIs are
              an example of the way in which technological access to yet
              largely sealed-off domains of the person may necessitate
              adjusting normative boundaries between the personal and the

              performance in highly challenging situations. In sports, flow can
              be enhanced by mindfulness training, which has been associated
              with frontal theta activity (4-8 Hz). Moreover, frontal-midline
              theta oscillations were shown to subserve control processes in a
              large variety of cognitive tasks. Based on previous theta
              neurofeedback training studies, which revealed that one training
              session is sufficient to enhance motor performance, the present
              study investigated whether one 30-minute session of
              frontal-midline theta neurofeedback training (1) enhances flow
              experience additionally to motor performance in a finger tapping
              task, and (2) transfers to cognitive control processes in an
              n-back task. Participants, who were able to successfully
              upregulate their theta activity during neurofeedback training
              (responders), showed better motor performance and flow experience
              after training than participants, who did not enhance their theta
              activity (non-responders). Across all participants, increase of
              theta activity during training was associated with motor
              performance enhancement from pretest to posttest irrespective of
              pre-training performance. Interestingly, theta training gains
              were also linked to the increase of flow experience, even when
              corresponding increases in motor performance were controlled for.
              Results for the n-back task were not significant. Even though
              these findings are mainly correlational in nature and additional
              flow-promoting influences need to be investigated, the present
              findings suggest that frontal-midline theta neurofeedback

               movements are recorded during system use and later analyzed
               retrospectively; however, the eye movements do not affect the
               interface in real time. As a direct control medium, the eye
               movements are obtained and used in real time as an input to the
               user--computer dialogue. The eye movements might be the sole
               input, typically for disabled users or hands-busy applications,
               or might be used as one of several inputs, combining with mouse,
               keyboard, sensors, or other devices. From the perspective of

  abstract = "Many applied problems require a covariance matrix estimator that
              is not only invertible, but also well-conditioned (that is,
              inverting it does not amplify estimation error). For
              large-dimensional covariance matrices, the usual estimator---the

              that is both well-conditioned and more accurate than the sample
              covariance matrix asymptotically. This estimator is
              distribution-free and has a simple explicit formula that is easy

               ICA blindly decomposes multi-channel EEG data into maximally
               independent component processes (ICs) that typically express
               either particularly brain generated EEG activities or some type
               of non-brain artifacts (line or other environmental noise, eye
               blinks and other eye movements, or scalp or heart muscle
               activity). Each brain and non-brain IC is identified with an
               activity time course (its `activation') and a set of relative
               strengths of its projections (by volume conduction) to the
               recording electrodes (its `scalp map'). Many non-articraft IC
               scalp maps strongly resemble the projection of a single dipole,
               allowing the location and orientation of the best-fitting
               equivalent dipole (or other source model) to be easily
               determined. In favorable circumstances, ICA decomposition of
               high-density scalp EEG data appears to allow concurrent
               monitoring, with high time resolution, of separate EEG
               activities in twenty or more separate cortical EEG source areas.
               We illustrate the differences between ICA and traditional
               approaches to EEG analysis by comparing time courses and mean
               event related spectral perturbations (ERSPs) of scalp channel
               and IC data. Comparing IC activities across subjects
               necessitates clustering of similar Ics based on common dynamic
               and/or spatial features. We discuss and illustrate such a
               component clustering strategy. In sum, continued application of
               ICA methods in EEG research should continue to yield new
               insights into the nature and role of the complex macroscopic
               cortical dynamics captured by scalp electrode recordings.",

              environmental abilities, e.g., asking people to rate their

              objective measures of these abilities quite highly. In this

              environmental spatial ability, the Santa Barbara Sense of

  abstract  = "OBJECTIVE: Recent research has successfully introduced the
               application of robotics and mechatronics to functional
               assessment and motor therapy. Measurements of movement
               initiation in isometric conditions are widely used in clinical
               rehabilitation and their importance in functional assessment has
               been demonstrated for specific parts of the human body. The
               determination of the voluntary movement initiation time, also
               referred to as onset time, represents a challenging issue since
               the time window characterizing the movement onset is of
               particular relevance for the understanding of recovery
               mechanisms after a neurological damage. Establishing it manually
               as well as a troublesome task may also introduce oversight
               errors and loss of information. METHODS: The most commonly used
               methods for automatic onset time detection compare the raw
               signal, or some extracted measures such as its derivatives
               (i.e., velocity and acceleration) with a chosen threshold.
               However, they suffer from high variability and systematic errors
               because of the weakness of the signal, the abnormality of
               response profiles as well as the variability of movement
               initiation times among patients. In this paper, we introduce a
               technique to optimise onset detection according to each input
               signal. It is based on a classification system that enables us
               to establish which deterministic method provides the most
               accurate onset time on the basis of information directly derived
               from the raw signal. RESULTS: The approach was tested on
               annotated force and torque datasets. Each dataset is constituted
               by 768 signals acquired from eight anatomical districts in 96
               patients who carried out six tasks related to common daily
               activities. The results show that the proposed technique
               improves not only on the performance achieved by each of the
               deterministic methods, but also on that attained by a group of
               clinical experts. CONCLUSIONS: The paper describes a
               classification system detecting the voluntary movement
               initiation time and adaptable to different signals. By using a
               set of features directly derived from raw data, we obtained
               promising results. Furthermore, although the technique has been
               developed within the scope of isometric force and torque signal
               analysis, it can be applied to other detection problems where
               several simple detectors are available.",

               representation of their surrounding environment or a 'cognitive

               navigation in humans and animals has greatly increased our
               understanding of how this highly complex feat is achieved. In
               turn this has inspired half a century of electrophysiological
               spatial navigation and memory research which has further
               advanced our understanding of the brain. In particular, three
               functional cell types have been suggested to underlie cognitive
               mapping processes; place cells, head direction cells and grid
               cells. However, there are numerous other spatially modulated
               neurons in the brain. For a more complete understanding of the

               object-oriented actions: grasping a tea-cup and impossible
               grasping of a tea-cup (same goal but the grasp was mechanically
               hindered). Experiment 2 included a subset of 7 subjects from
               Exp. 1 and the action was reaching a tea-cup; this control
               condition had a different goal but was kinematically similar to

               The main result is that parietal areas were involved in grasping

               that for impossible grasping, except for a frontal activity only
               detected in the latter condition. It is concluded that the

               resting-state functional connectivity have shown that major
               depressive disorder (MDD) is characterized by increased
               connectivity within the default mode network (DMN) and between
               the DMN and the frontoparietal network (FPN). However, much
               remains unknown about abnormalities in higher frequency (>1 Hz)
               synchronization. Findings of abnormal synchronization in
               specific frequencies would contribute to a better understanding
               of the potential neurophysiological origins of disrupted
               functional connectivity in MDD. METHODS: We used the high
               temporal resolution of electroencephalography to compare the
               spectral properties of resting-state functional connectivity in
               individuals with MDD (n = 65) with healthy control subjects (n =
               79) and examined the extent to which connectivity disturbances
               were evident in a third sample of individuals in remission from
               depression (n = 30). Exact low resolution electromagnetic
               tomography was used to compute intracortical activity from
               regions within the DMN and FPN, and functional connectivity was
               computed using lagged phase synchronization. RESULTS: Compared
               to control subjects, the MDD group showed greater within-DMN
               beta 2 band (18.5-21 Hz) connectivity and greater beta 1 band
               (12.5-18 Hz) connectivity between the DMN and FPN. This
               hyperconnectivity was not observed in the remitted MDD group.
               However, greater beta 1 band DMN-FPN connectivity was associated
               with more frequent depressive episodes since first depression
               onset, even after controlling for current symptom severity.
               CONCLUSIONS: These findings extend our understanding of the
               neurophysiological basis of abnormal resting-state functional
               connectivity in MDD and indicate that elevations in
               high-frequency DMN-FPN connectivity may be a neural marker

              this review, we discuss studies that concern knowledge of others
              as members of a group and as individuals with habitual
              dispositions. These include studies of group stereotypes and of
              individual reputation, derived either from experience in
              reciprocal social interactions such as economic games or from
              indirect observation and cultural information. In the second part
              of the review, we focus on processes that underlie our knowledge
              about actions, intentions, feelings and beliefs. We discuss
              studies on the ability to predict the course of motor actions and

               attention on an externally presented item (external spatial
               attention) are similar. Part of the neuroimaging support for
               this view may be due to the employed experimental procedures.
               Furthermore, as internal spatial attention may have a more
               induced than evoked nature some effects may not have been
               visible in event related analyses of the electroencephalogram
               (EEG), which limits the possibility to demonstrate differences.
               In the current study, a colored frame cued which stimulus, one
               out of four presented in separate quadrants, required a
               response, which depended on the form of the cued stimulus
               (circle or square). Importantly, the frame occurred either
               before (precue), simultaneously with (simultaneous cue), or
               after the stimuli (postcue). The precue and simultaneous cue
               condition both concern external attention, while the postcue
               condition implies the involvement of internal spatial attention.
               Event-related lateralizations (ERLs), reflecting evoked effects,
               and lateralized power spectra (LPS), reflecting both evoked and
               induced effects, were determined. ERLs revealed a posterior
               contralateral negativity (PCN) only in the precue condition. LPS
               analyses on the raw EEG showed early increased contralateral
               theta power at posterior sites and later increased ipsilateral
               alpha power at occipito-temporal sites in all cue conditions.

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Selecting optimal stimulation parameters from
              numerous possibilities is a major obstacle for assessing the
              efficacy of non-invasive brain stimulation. OBJECTIVE: We
              demonstrate that Bayesian optimization can rapidly search through
              large parameter spaces and identify subject-level stimulation
              parameters in real-time. METHODS: To validate the method,
              Bayesian optimization was employed using participants' binary
              judgements about the intensity of phosphenes elicited through
              tACS. RESULTS: We demonstrate the efficiency of Bayesian
              optimization in identifying parameters that maximize phosphene
              intensity in a short timeframe (5 min for >190 possibilities).
              Our results replicate frequency-dependent effects across three
              montages and show phase-dependent effects of phosphene
              perception. Computational modelling explains that these phase
              effects result from constructive/destructive interference of the
              current reaching the retinas. Simulation analyses demonstrate the
              method's versatility for complex response functions, even when
              accounting for noisy observations. CONCLUSION: Alongside
              subjective ratings, this method can be used to optimize tACS
              parameters based on behavioral and neural measures and has the

               investigating 22 different HRV measures, 9 of which reported by
               at least 2 studies and therefore meta-analyzed in this review.
               Four measures in time and non-linear domains, associated with a
               normal degree of HRV variations resulted significantly depressed

               suggesting a sympathetic activation and a parasympathetic
               withdrawal during acute mental stress. Finally, among the 15
               non-linear measures extracted, only 2 were reported by at least
               2 studies, therefore pooled, and only one resulted significantly
               depressed, suggesting a reduced chaotic behaviour during mental
               stress. HRV resulted significantly depressed during mental
               stress, showing a reduced variability and less chaotic
               behaviour. The pooled frequency domain measures demonstrated a

              arithmetic operation were used to develop an efficient cognitive
              state assessment model. The feature set extracted in this study

               instruments for the upper extremity functional assessment are
               clinical scales, that previously have been standardized and
               validated, but have a high subjective component depending on the
               observer who scores the test. But they are not enough to assess
               motor strategies used during movements, and their use in
               combination with other more objective measures is necessary. The
               objective of the present review is to provide an overview on
               objective metrics found in literature with the aim of
               quantifying the upper extremity performance during functional
               tasks, regardless of the equipment or system used for

               combination of a series of keywords. The full scientific papers

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: The main obstacle in interpreting EEG/MEG data in
              terms of brain connectivity is the fact that because of volume
              conduction, the activity of a single brain source can be observed
              in many channels. Here, we present an approach which is
              insensitive to false connectivity arising from volume conduction.
              METHODS: We show that the (complex) coherency of non-interacting
              sources is necessarily real and, hence, the imaginary part of
              coherency provides an excellent candidate to study brain
              interactions. Although the usual magnitude and phase of coherency
              contain the same information as the real and imaginary parts, we
              argue that the Cartesian representation is far superior for
              studying brain interactions. The method is demonstrated for EEG
              measurements of voluntary finger movement. RESULTS: We found: (a)
              from 5 s before to movement onset a relatively weak interaction
              around 20 Hz between left and right motor areas where the
              contralateral side leads the ipsilateral side; and (b)
              approximately 2-4 s after movement, a stronger interaction also
              at 20 Hz in the opposite direction. CONCLUSIONS: It is possible
              to reliably detect brain interaction during movement from EEG
              data. SIGNIFICANCE: The method allows unambiguous detection of
              brain interaction from rhythmic EEG/MEG data.",

               have disclosed the generator mechanisms of each identifiable
               component of movement-related cortical potentials (MRCPs) to
               some extent. The initial slow segment of BP, called 'early BP'
               in this article, begins about 2 s before the movement onset in
               the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA) with no
               site-specificity and in the SMA proper according to the
               somatotopic organization, and shortly thereafter in the lateral
               premotor cortex bilaterally with relatively clear somatotopy.
               About 400 ms before the movement onset, the steeper negative
               slope, called 'late BP' in this article (also referred to as
               NS'), occurs in the contralateral primary motor cortex (M1) and
               lateral premotor cortex with precise somatotopy. These two
               phases of BP are differentially influenced by various factors,
               especially by complexity of the movement which enhances only the
               late BP. Event-related desynchronization (ERD) of beta frequency
               EEG band before self-initiated movements shows a different
               temporospatial pattern from that of the BP, suggesting different
               neuronal mechanisms for the two. BP has been applied for
               investigating pathophysiology of various movement disorders.
               Volitional motor inhibition or muscle relaxation is preceded by
               BP quite similar to that preceding voluntary muscle contraction.
               Since BP of typical waveforms and temporospatial pattern does
               not occur before organic involuntary movements, BP is used for
               detecting the participation of the 'voluntary motor system' in

              be noninvasively and directly measured from the scalp through
              electroencephalography (EEG), as response, when a person realizes
              they are making an error during a task (as a consequence of a
              cognitive error performed from the user). It has been shown that
              ErrPs can be automatically detected with time-discrete feedback
              tasks, which are widely applied in the Brain-Computer Interface
              (BCI) field for error correction or adaptation. In this work, a
              semi-supervised algorithm, namely the Functional Source
              Separation (FSS), is proposed to estimate a spatial filter for
              learning the ErrPs and to enhance the evoked potentials. METHODS:
              EEG data recorded on six subjects were used to evaluate the
              proposed method based on FFS algorithm in comparison with the
              xDAWN algorithm. FSS- and xDAWN-based methods were compared also
              to the Cz and FCz single channel. Single-trial classification was
              considered to evaluate the performances of the approaches. (Both
              the approaches were evaluated on single-trial classification of
              EEGs.) RESULTS: The results presented using the Bayesian Linear
              Discriminant Analysis (BLDA) classifier, show that FSS (accuracy
              0.92, sensitivity 0.95, specificity 0.81, F1-score 0.95)
              overcomes the other methods (Cz - accuracy 0.72, sensitivity

               the path to the goal while the entorhinal cortex represents the
               vector to the goal. It also reveals that the engagement of the

              stores. Experiment 2 varied the degree to which landmark and
              layout cues were preserved across two successively learned towns.
              When spatial layout was preserved, transfer was low if only

               this knowledge of navigation space: (a) 'cognitive map' with
               metric Euclidean structure and a consistent coordinate system,
               (b) 'topological graph' or network of paths between places, and
               (c) 'labelled graph' incorporating local metric information
               about path lengths and junction angles. In two experiments,
               participants walked in a non-Euclidean environment, a virtual
               hedge maze containing two 'wormholes' that visually rotated and
               teleported them between locations. During training, they learned
               the metric locations of eight target objects from a 'home'
               location, which were visible individually. During testing,
               shorter wormhole routes to a target were preferred, and novel
               shortcuts were directional, contrary to the topological
               hypothesis. Shortcuts were strongly biased by the wormholes,
               with mean constant errors of 37° and 41° (45° expected),
               revealing violations of the metric postulates in spatial
               knowledge. In addition, shortcuts to targets near wormholes
               shifted relative to flanking targets, revealing 'rips' (86\% of
               cases), 'folds' (91\%), and ordinal reversals (66\%) in spatial
               knowledge. Moreover, participants were completely unaware of

               insensitivity to Euclidean structure. The probability of the
               shortcut data under the Euclidean map model and labelled graph
               model indicated decisive support for the latter (BFGM>100). We
               conclude that knowledge of navigation space is best
               characterized by a labelled graph, in which local metric
               information is approximate, geometrically inconsistent, and not
               embedded in a common coordinate system. This class of 'cognitive

  title    = "The grasping side of post-error slowing",
  author   = "Ceccarini, Francesco and Castiello, Umberto",
  abstract = "A common finding across many speeded reaction time (RT) tasks is
              that people tend to respond more slowly after making an error.
              This phenomenon, known as post-error slowing (PES), has been
              traditionally hypothesized to reflect a strategic increase in
              response caution, aimed at preventing the occurrence of new
              errors. However, this interpretation of PES has been challenged
              on multiple fronts. Firstly, recent investigations have suggested
              that errors may produce a decrement in performance accuracy and
              that PES might occur because error processing has a detrimental
              effect on subsequent information processing. Secondly, previous
              research has been criticized because of the limited ecological
              validity of speeded RT tasks. In the present study, we
              investigated error-reactivity in the context of goal-directed
              actions, in order to examine the extent to which PES effects
              impact on realistic and complex movements. Specifically, we
              investigated the effect of errors on the reach to grasp movement
              (Experiment 1). In addition to RTs, we performed a kinematical
              analysis in order to explore the underlying reorganization of the
              movements after an error. The results of the present study showed
              that error reactivity strategically influences the grasping
              component of the action, whereas the reaching component appears
              to be impermeable to PES. The resistance of the reaching
              component to PES was confirmed in a second 'only reaching'
              experiment (Experiment 2). These finding supports the hypothesis
              that error reactivity is a flexible process whose effects on
              behavior also depend on the motor components involved in the
              action.",

              world, and how they cannot change it, in order to make rational
              decisions for their forthcoming actions, and to adapt to their
              current environment. Previous research on the sense of agency,
              based largely on subjective ratings, failed to dissociate the
              sensitivity of sense of agency (i.e., the extent to which
              individual sense of agency tracks actual instrumental control
              over external events) from judgment criteria (i.e., the extent to
              which individuals self-attribute agency independent of their
              actual influence over external events). Furthermore, few studies
              have examined whether individuals have metacognitive access to
              the internal processes underlying the sense of agency. We
              developed a novel two-alternative-forced choice (2FAC) control
              detection task, in which participants identified which of two
              visual objects was more strongly controlled by their voluntary
              movement. The actual level of control over the target object was
              manipulated by adjusting the proportion of its motion that was
              driven by the participant's movement, compared to the proportion
              driven by a pre-recorded movement by another agent, using a
              staircase to hold 2AFC control detection accuracy at 70\%.
              Participants identified which of the two visual objects they
              controlled, and also made a binary confidence judgment regarding
              their control detection judgment. We calculated a bias-free
              measure of first-order sensitivity (d') for detection control at
              any given level of participant's own movement. The proportion of
              pre-recorded movements determined by the stairecase could then be
              used as an index of control detection ability. We identified two
              distinct processes underlying first-order detection of control:
              one based on instantaneous sensory predictions for the current
              movement, and one based on detection of a regular motor-visual
              relation across a series of movements. Further, we found large
              individual differences across 40 particpants in metacognitive
              sensitivity (meta-d') even though first-order sensitivity of
              control detection was well controlled. Using structural equation
              modelling (SEM), we showed that metacognition was negatively
              correlated with the predictive process component of detection of
              control. This result is inconsistent with previous hypotheses
              that detection of control relies on metacognitive monitoring of a
              predictive circuit. Instead, it suggests that predictive
              mechanisms that compute sense of agency may operate
              unconsciously.",

              provide a unifying functional explanation of neural population
              coding and dynamics: predictive coding and Bayesian inference.
              Here, we describe the two theories and their combination into a
              single framework: Bayesian predictive coding. We clarify how the
              two theories can be distinguished, despite sharing core
              computational concepts and addressing an overlapping set of
              empirical phenomena. We argue that predictive coding is an
              algorithmic/representational motif that can serve several
              different computational goals of which Bayesian inference is but
              one. Conversely, while Bayesian inference can utilize predictive
              coding, it can also be realized by a variety of other
              representations. We critically evaluate the experimental evidence
              supporting Bayesian predictive coding and discuss how to test it
              more directly.",

              over one's actions (``sense of agency''). Sense of agency may
              depend on internal motoric signals, and general inferences about
              external events. We used priming to modulate the sense of agency
              for voluntary and involuntary movements, by modifying the content
              of conscious thought prior to moving. Trials began with the
              presentation of one of two supraliminal primes, which
              corresponded to the effect of a voluntary action participants
              subsequently made. The perceived interval between movement and
              effect was used as an implicit measure of sense of agency. Primes
              modulated perceived intervals for both voluntary and involuntary
              movements, but the modulation was greatest for involuntary
              movements. A second experiment showed that this modulation
              depended on prime-movement (temporal) contiguity. We propose that
              sense of agency is based on a combination of internal motoric

              which one's action and inferred effect seem closer in time than
              they otherwise would (Haggard, Clark, \& Kalogeras, 2002). Using
              a novel, naturalistic paradigm, we conducted two experiments to
              test this hypothesis and examine the relationship between binding
              and self-reported authorship. In both experiments, an important
              authorship indicator - consistency between one's action and a
              subsequent event - was manipulated, and its effects on binding
              and self-reported authorship were measured. Results showed that
              action-event consistency enhanced both binding and self-reported
              authorship, supporting the hypothesis that binding arises from an
              inference of authorship. At the same time, evidence for a
              dissociation emerged, with consistency having a more robust
              effect on self-reports than on binding. Taken together, these
              results suggest that binding and self-reports reveal different

               reported the 'intentional binding' effect (Haggard, Clark, \&
               Kalogeras, 2002). The intentional binding effect refers to the
               subjective compression of the temporal interval between a
               voluntary action and its external sensory consequence. Since the

              Recently, a distinction between implicit and explicit aspects of

              found in other areas of cognition, notably learning. However,
              there is yet no strong evidence supporting separable implicit and
              explicit components of sense of agency. The so-called 'Perruchet
              paradigm' offers one of the few convincing demonstrations of
              separable implicit and explicit learning systems. We adopted this
              approach to evaluate the implicit-explicit distinction in the
              context of a simple task in which outcomes were probabilistically
              caused by actions. In line with our initial predictions, we found

              experience of agency, and its neural correlates, remain poorly
              understood. Previous studies show that the angular gyrus is
              activated when participants explicitly judge that they lack
              agency. In contrast, the positive sense of agency over external
              events is associated with distortions of time perception. Here,

               Whereas participants in most psychological experiments sit
               upright, many prominent neuroimaging techniques (e.g.,
               functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)) require
               participants to lie supine. Such postural discrepancies may hold
               important implications for brain function in general and for
               fMRI in particular. We directly investigated the effect of
               posture on spontaneous brain dynamics by recording scalp
               electrical activity in four orthostatic conditions (lying
               supine, inclined at 45°, sitting upright, and standing erect).
               Here we show that upright versus supine posture increases
               widespread high-frequency oscillatory activity. Our
               electroencephalographic findings highlight the importance of

               administered to objectively assess spatial orientation in these
               neurodegenerative conditions. In this study we investigated

               controls using a novel virtual supermarket task as well as
               voxel-based morphometry (VBM). We compared performance on this

               integrity of the RSC was identified as a key neural correlate of

               i) it is feasible to assess spatial orientation objectively via
               our novel Supermarket task; ii) impaired orientation is a
               prominent feature that can be applied clinically to discriminate

              space. However, it has also been suggested that the motor coding
              of manipulable objects perceived in peripersonal space depends on
              an anticipation to interact with them. The present study aims at
              clarifying this issue by analyzing healthy adults' EEG activity
              on the centro-parietal region while perceptually judging
              intrinsic (prototypical or distorted shape) or extrinsic
              (reachable or not reachable location) properties of visual

              judgment tasks, time-frequency decomposition of EEG signals was
              performed across the first 1000 ms following object presentation
              for trials on which no post-stimulus response was required (90\%

              a desynchronization of $\mu$ rhythm starting 300 ms after object
              presentation, but only when the objects were presented with a
              prototypical shape in peripersonal space. For those objects,
              desynchronization of $\mu$ rhythm diminished progressively from

              current action goals, such that action relevant sensory

              In three experiments, rather than varying movement type (grasp vs
              point), the magnitude of a prepared movement (power vs precision
              grasps) was manipulated while visual processing of object size,

               been well investigated in the past, and they may have
               considerable potentials for repositioning. A grand number of
               plant alkaloids inhibit syngeneic or xenograft tumor growth in
               vivo. Molecular modes of action in cancer cells include
               induction of cell cycle arrest, intrinsic and extrinsic
               apoptosis, autophagy, inhibition of angiogenesis and glycolysis,
               stress and anti-inflammatory responses, regulation of immune
               functions, cellular differentiation, and inhibition of invasion
               and metastasis. Numerous underlying signaling processes are
               affected by plant alkaloids. Furthermore, plant alkaloids
               suppress carcinogenesis, indicating chemopreventive properties.
               Some plant alkaloids reveal toxicities such as hepato-, nephro-
               or genotoxicity, which disqualifies them for repositioning

               The present survey of the published literature clearly

              relatively well documented in humans and primates, how these
              regions communicate to help understand and predict actions
              remains poorly understood. Traditional views emphasized a
              feed-forward architecture in which visual features are organized
              into increasingly complex representations that feed onto motor
              programs in parietal and then premotor cortices where the
              matching of observed actions upon the observer's own motor
              programs contributes to action understanding. Predictive coding
              models place less emphasis on feed-forward connections and
              propose that feed-back connections from premotor regions back to
              parietal and visual neurons represent predictions about upcoming
              actions that can supersede visual inputs when actions become
              predictable, with visual input then merely representing
              prediction errors. Here we leverage the notion that feed-back
              connections target specific cortical layers to help adjudicate
              across these views. Specifically, we test whether observing
              sequences of hand actions in their natural order, which permits
              participants to predict upcoming actions, triggers more feed-back
              input to parietal regions than seeing the same actions in a
              scrambled sequence that hinders making predictions. Using
              submillimeter fMRI acquisition at 7T, we find that watching
              predictable sequences triggers more action-related activity (as
              measured using intersubject functional correlation) in the
              parietal cortical area PFt at depths receiving feed-back
              connections (layers III and V/VI) than watching the exact same
              actions in scrambled and hence unpredictable sequence. In
              addition, functional connectivity analysis performed using
              intersubject functional connectivity confirms that these
              increased action-related signals in PFt could originate from
              ventral premotor region BA44. This data showcases the utility of
              intersubject functional correlation in combination with 7T MRI to
              explore the architecture of social cognition under more
              naturalistic conditions, and provides evidence for models that

               to bind sensory signals emanating from a common source, but to
               segregate those from different sources [1]. Temporal
               correlations and synchrony act as prominent cues for
               multisensory integration [2-4], but the neural mechanisms by
               which such cues are identified remain unclear. Predictive coding
               suggests that the brain iteratively optimizes an internal model

               predictions and the sensory inputs [5,6]. This model enables the

               audiovisual asynchrony. As the visual system generates the
               dominant temporal predictions for visual leading asynchrony, the
               delayed auditory inputs are expected to generate a prediction
               error signal in the auditory system (and vice versa for auditory
               leading asynchrony). Using functional magnetic resonance imaging
               (fMRI), we measured participants' brain responses to
               synchronous, visual leading and auditory leading movies of
               speech, sinewave speech or music. In line with predictive
               coding, auditory leading asynchrony elicited a prediction error

               cortices. Our results reveal predictive coding as a generic

  abstract  = "A fundamental challenge for the visual system is to integrate
               visual features into a coherent scene, known as the binding
               problem. The neural mechanisms of feature binding are hard to
               identify because of difficulties in separating active feature
               binding from feature co-occurrence. In previous studies on
               feature binding, visual features were superimposed and presented
               simultaneously. Neurons throughout the visual cortex are known
               to code multiple features. Therefore, the observed binding
               effects could be due to the physical co-occurrence of features
               and the sensory representation of feature pairings. It is
               uncertain whether the mechanisms responsible for perceptual
               binding were actually recruited. To address this issue, we
               performed psychophysical and fMRI experiments to investigate the
               neural mechanisms of a steady-state misbinding of color and
               motion, because feature misbinding is probably the most striking
               evidence for the active existence of the binding mechanisms. We
               found that adapting to the color-motion misbinding generated the
               color-contingent motion aftereffect, as well as the
               color-contingent motion adaptation effect in visual cortex.
               Notably, V2 exhibited the strongest adaptation effect, which
               significantly correlated with the aftereffect across subjects.
               Furthermore, effective connectivity analysis using dynamic
               causal modeling showed that the misbinding was closely
               associated with enhanced feedback from V4 and V5 to V2. These
               findings provide strong evidence for active feature binding in
               early visual cortex and suggest a critical role of reentrant
               connections from specialized intermediate areas to early visual

               operates by integrating self-motion cues over time, providing

               weighting them in proportion to their reliabilities. An emerging
               debate in neuroscience is to which extent multisensory
               integration emerges already in primary sensory areas or is
               deferred to higher-order association areas. This fMRI study used
               multivariate pattern decoding to characterize the computational
               principles that define how auditory and visual signals are
               integrated into spatial representations across the cortical
               hierarchy. Our results reveal small multisensory influences that
               were limited to a spatial window of integration in primary
               sensory areas. By contrast, parietal cortices integrated signals
               weighted by their sensory reliabilities and task relevance in

               optimality. Intriguingly, audiovisual integration in parietal

               signals were unlikely to originate from a common source. Our

               controlled the influence of non-visual signals on the formation
               of spatial representations, whereas in parietal cortices, it

               in stationary subjects. Here we used a unique clinical
               opportunity to examine theta within the human MTL during

               behavior, human psychology, electrophysiology, and cognitive
               neuroscience. Behavioral work suggests that reorientation
               involves two key abilities: first, the recovery of a spatial
               reference frame (a cognitive map) that is appropriate to the
               current environment; and second, the determination of one's
               heading and location relative to that reference frame.
               Electrophysiological recording studies, primarily in rodents,
               have revealed potential correlates of these operations in place,

              absent awareness, suggesting that neural processes predetermine
              behavior before conscious choice. Such early neural encoding
              challenges popular conceptions of human agency. It also raises
              fundamental questions for brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) that
              traditionally assume that neural activity reflects the user's
              conscious intentions. Here, we study the timing of human
              posterior parietal cortex single-neuron activity recorded from
              implanted microelectrode arrays relative to the explicit urge to
              initiate movement. Participants were free to choose when to move,
              whether to move, and what to move, and they retrospectively
              reported the time they felt the urge to move. We replicate prior
              studies by showing that posterior parietal cortex (PPC) neural
              activity sharply rises hundreds of milliseconds before the
              reported urge. However, we find that this ``preconscious''
              activity is part of a dynamic neural population response that
              initiates much earlier, when the participant first chooses to
              perform the task. Together with details of neural timing, our
              results suggest that PPC encodes an internal model of the motor
              planning network that transforms high-level task objectives into
              appropriate motor behavior. These new data challenge traditional
              interpretations of early neural activity and offer a more
              holistic perspective on the interplay between choice, behavior,
              and their neural underpinnings. Our results have important
              implications for translating BMIs into more complex real-world
              environments. We find that early neural dynamics are sufficient
              to drive BMI movements before the participant intends to initiate
              movement. Appropriate algorithms ensure that BMI movements align
              with the subject's awareness of choice.",

              on objective measurements of upper limb movements in children
              with hemiplegic cerebral palsy (HCP). Seventeen articles were
              selected following a systematic search. Analysed tasks varied
              from simple reaching and gross motor functions to complex, fine
              motor tasks. Spatiotemporal characteristics have been extensively
              studied and longer movement durations, slower movement speed and
              reduced trajectory straightness at the affected upper limb,
              compared to the non-affected side or healthy children, were most
              frequently reported. Joint kinematics has been far less studied.
              The limited data confirm the clinical impression of children with
              HCP using less elbow extension and supination to reach for an
              object, which is compensated by increased trunk flexion.
              Increased trunk involvement was also reported during gross motor
              functions. Although three-dimensional (3D) movement analysis
              seems promising to provide additional insights in the
              pathological upper limb movements observed in HCP, future
              standardisation of the entire protocol is crucial. No consensus
              exists on the procedures for data collection, processing,
              analysing and reporting of results, or what upper limb tasks
              should be assessed. The International Society of Biomechanics
              recently proposed recommendations on the definition of upper limb
              joint coordinate systems and rotation sequences. These guidelines
              were not yet applied in these studies. Although the diverse
              methodological approaches used in the studies complicate the
              comparison of published results, some general conclusions could
              be drawn. A further standardisation of the protocol for 3D upper
              limb movement analysis will provide the foundation for comparable
              and repeatable results and eventually facilitate the selection

              perception of whole-body rotation and spatial updating, and to
              determine whether the brain uses mainly angular velocity or
              rotational duration to re-orient the body. Ten healthy
              blindfolded adults stood barefoot on a horizontal rotating
              platform. Participants had to maintain their balance while being
              passively rotated by a platform through 45°, 90°, 135°, 180° and
              360°, clockwise (CW) and counter-clockwise (CCW). At the end of
              platform rotation, participants had to give their estimation of
              the angle. They then had to actively reproduce it in the opposite
              direction. Three different conditions were applied: one which
              involved different peak cosinusoidal angular velocity profiles
              (18°/s, 35°/s, 53°/s, 71°/s and 141°/s) at constant duration of
              stimulus (4 s); one which involved different stimulus durations
              (1.25 s, 2.5 s, 3.75 s, 5 s and 10 s) at constant peak velocity
              (57°/s); and one where subjects had to reproduce a specific angle
              without prior stimulus imposed by the platform. In the
              reproduction phase, results show overestimation of stimulus from
              -180° to 180° in all three conditions; however, $\pm$360°
              rotations were underestimated only in the first two conditions.
              Comparing stimulus perception and reproduction, the perceived
              angle corresponded to that reproduced in the range from -180° to
              180°; however, $\pm$360° angles were correctly perceived but
              inaccurately reproduced. Thus, the interconnection between
              movement and information via the vestibular/proprioceptive
              systems is essential to evaluate the body position in space;
              however, the spatial errors show the key importance of sight in
              correcting the errors caused by the cue integration.",

              electroencephalogram (EEG) elicited by tones, which are not
              related to VR, as an objective indicator for the presence
              experience within a virtual environment. Forty participants
              navigated through a virtual city and rated their sensation of
              being in the VR (experience of presence), while hearing frequent
              standard tones and infrequent deviant tones, which were
              irrelevant for the VR task. Different ERP components elicited by
              the tones were compared between participants experiencing a high
              level of presence and participants with a low feeling of presence
              in the virtual city. Early ERP components, which are more linked
              to automatic stimulus processing, showed no correlation with
              presence experience. In contrast, an increased presence
              experience was associated with decreased late negative slow wave
              amplitudes, which are associated with central stimulus processing
              and allocation of attentional resources. This result supports the
              assumption that increased presence is associated with a strong
              allocation of attentional resources to the VR, which leads to a
              decrease of attentional resources available for processing
              VR-irrelevant stimuli. Hence, ERP components elicited by the
              tones are reduced. Particularly, frontal negative slow waves
              turned out to be accurate predictors for presence experience.
              Summarizing, late ERPs elicited by VR-irrelevant tones differ as
              a function of presence experience in VR and provide a valuable

               Event-Related Potentials (ERPs), as potential objective
               indicators of presence in games. A total of 34 participants were

               self-reported presence evoked from experiencing a horror game

               less or insufficient perceptual resources available for

              human abilities through medicine or technology. This has
              historically been achieved by consuming chemical substances that
              improve a selected ability or by installing implants which
              require medical operations. Both of these methods of augmentation
              can be invasive. Augmented abilities have also been achieved with
              external tools, such as eyeglasses, binoculars, microscopes or
              highly sensitive microphones. Lately, augmented reality and
              multimodal interaction technologies have enabled non-invasive
              ways to augment human. In this article, we first discuss the
              field and related terms. We provide relevant definitions based on
              the present understanding of the field. This is followed by a
              summary of existing work in augmented senses, action, and
              cognition. Our contribution to the future includes a model for
              wearable augmentation. In addition, we present a call for
              research to realize this vision. Then, we discuss future human
              abilities. Wearable technologies may act as mediators for human
              augmentation, in the same manner as eyeglasses once
              revolutionized human vision. Non-invasive and easy-to-use
              wearable extensions will enable lengthening the active life for
              aging citizens or supporting the full inclusion of people with
              special needs in society, but there are also potential problems.
              Therefore, we conclude by discussing ethical and societal issues:

              accessibility, safety and balance, and unpredictable future.",

               design research: we identify gaps in knowledge regarding bodily
               integration design and propose, in response, two key dimensions
               along which bodily integration systems can be categorized:
               bodily agency and bodily ownership. Conceiving each dimension

               integration: Super-Body, Tele-Body, Chauffeured-Body, and

              in the virtual reality based on electroencephalographic data.
              MATERIALS AND METHODS: It analyzes stable electroencephalographic
              patterns that allow us to trace a connection between a brain
              activity and purposeful actions of an individual in various
              environments. The subjects of the study were experienced downhill
              skiers equipped with electroencephalographs, who performed
              real-life skiing on a downhill course, after which they were
              offered a virtual simulation of downhill skiing using an HTCVive
              headset and a programmed 2D or desktop simulator. RESULTS: The
              results of measurement showed neuropatterns similar in the cases
              of virtual reality simulation and physical downhill skiing (in
              part of changes in space and power parameters of
              electroencephalograms in the different frequency ranges) and
              different from a 2D simulator. This observation enables us to
              make an assumption of realism of a virtual reality simulator in
              the context of reproduction of the subjects' similar cognitive
              and semantic connections and motor programs. DISCUSSION: Further

              performing psychophysiological tests (time response to a mobile

  title    = "Phenomenology in nursing studies: New perspectives",
  author   = "Zahavi, Dan and Martiny, Kristian M M",
  abstract = "Nursing studies have for decades drawn on the philosophical
              tradition of phenomenology when developing their own methodology
              and theoretical foundation. This use and application of
              phenomenology has, however, not been met with universal approval.
              One prominent and persistent opponent has been John Paley, who
              has sent a clear message to the nursing community: If you are
              looking for philosophical inspiration or methodological guidance,
              do not look to phenomenology. As we argue in the article, in
              formulating his criticism, Paley completely overlooks a rich
              tradition of applied phenomenology that dates back to the
              beginning of the 20th century and which has undergone a momentous
              revival during the last 20--25 years. That Paley seems oblivious
              to this tradition is one thing. What is more astonishing is that
              this also holds true for the vast majority of those scholars
              working within nursing science who happens to be interested in
              phenomenology. The aim of this article is, first, to present and
              consider Paley's criticism in some detail and, then, to discuss
              some of the significant applications of phenomenology that have
              often been overlooked by qualitative researchers. As has been
              amply demonstrated over the years, phenomenology can not only
              make a difference in the handling, analysis, and interpretation
              of the available data, but also, in how the data are obtained in
              the first place, for instance, through special interview
              techniques. We will consider some central figures in classical
              phenomenological psychology and phenomenological psychiatry, and
              present some of the more recent developments in cognitive
              science. We will then discuss three concrete cases that
              demonstrate how phenomenology has been applied in clinical work
              with patients with schizophrenia, cerebral palsy, and hemispatial
              neglect. Our main message to qualitative researchers interested
              in phenomenology is the following. You should also start to
              consider and draw inspiration from the way in which phenomenology
              has been applied outside of the domain of qualitative research.
              There are quite successful applications of phenomenology to be
              found elsewhere, applications that can offer substantial
              theoretical and methodological support to qualitative
              researchers. Relevant resources include classical
              phenomenological psychology, classical and contemporary
              phenomenological psychiatry, and contemporary discussions of
              naturalized phenomenology.",

               input and thus requires processing that is particularly suited
               to extract stimulus relations within a sequence. Evidence from a
               variety of paradigms converges to show that the auditory system
               automatically uses stimulus predictability for facilitating its
               sequential processing. This type of predictive processing does
               not require attentional processing of the sounds or cognitive
               control of the predictions, nor does it involve the preparation
               of motor responses to the auditory stimuli. We will present a
               taxonomy of paradigms and resulting electrophysiological
               indicators for such automatic predictive processing in terms of
               event-related potential components and oscillatory activity.
               These indicators will include signals of fulfilled predictions
               (match signals such as N1 attenuation, repetition positivity,
               and early evoked gamma band response enhancement) as well as
               signals of violated predictions (mismatch signals such as the
               mismatch negativity and stimulus omission responses). We will
               show how recent approaches have revealed particularly early
               indicators of predictive processing down to the level of the
               auditory middle-latency responses. We will discuss the strength
               of the various indicators in terms of a truly predictive account
               of auditory processing (as opposed to, e.g., a retrospective

               benefits of a predictive system within and beyond auditory
               processing. In conclusion, we argue in favor of the overwhelming
               evidence for predictions in audition, flexibly instantiated on
               different levels and timescales, and we aim to provide guidance

              Our cognitive processes and supporting brain dynamics are
              inherently coupled both to our environment and to our physical
              structure and actions. To investigate human cognition in its most
              natural forms demands imaging of brain activity while
              participants perform naturally motivated actions and interactions
              within a full three-dimensional environment. Transient,
              distributed brain activity patterns supporting spontaneous motor
              actions, performed in pursuit of naturally motivated goals, may
              involve any or all parts of cortex and must be precisely timed at
              a speed faster than the speed of thought and action. Hemodynamic
              imaging methods give information about brain dynamics on a much
              slower scale, and established techniques for imaging brain
              dynamics in all modalities forbid participants from making

               spatial transformations applied to the same scalp-recorded EEG
               data. The spatial transformations applied are two referencing
               schemes (average and linked earlobes), the surface Laplacian,
               and beamforming (a distributed source localization procedure).
               EEG data were collected during a speeded reaction time task that
               provided a comparison of activity between error vs. correct
               responses. Analyses focused on time-frequency power, frequency
               band-specific inter-electrode connectivity, and within-subject
               cross-trial correlations between EEG activity and reaction time.
               Time-frequency power analyses showed similar patterns of
               midfrontal delta-theta power for errors compared to correct
               responses across all spatial transformations. Beamforming
               additionally revealed error-related anterior and lateral

               this research is to demonstrate that combining independent
               component analysis with the surface Laplacian can eliminate EMG
               contamination of the EEG, and to validate that this processing
               does not degrade expected neurogenic signals. The method
               involves sequential application of ICA, using a manual procedure
               to identify and discard EMG components, followed by the surface
               Laplacian. The extent of decontamination is quantified by
               comparing processed EEG with EMG-free data that was recorded
               during pharmacologically induced neuromuscular paralysis. The
               combination of the ICA procedure and the surface Laplacian, with
               a flexible spherical spline, results in a strong suppression of
               EMG contamination at all scalp sites and frequencies.
               Furthermore, the ICA and surface Laplacian procedure does not
               impair the detection of well-known, cerebral responses; alpha
               activity with eyes-closed; ERP components (N1, P2) in response
               to an auditory oddball task; and steady state responses to
               photic and auditory stimulation. Finally, more flexible
               spherical splines increase the suppression of EMG by the surface
               Laplacian. We postulate this is due to ICA enabling the removal
               of local muscle sources of EMG contamination and the Laplacian

               endeavor lies with diagnosticity. Despite different underlying
               causes, the physiological correlates of workload and acute
               psychological stress manifest in rather similar ways and can be
               easily confounded. The current work aimed to build a diagnostic
               model of mental state through the simultaneous classification of
               mental workload (varied through three levels of the n-back task)
               and acute stress (the presence/absence of aversive sounds) with
               machine learning. Using functional near infrared spectroscopy
               (fNIRS) and electrocardiography (ECG), the model's classifiers
               was above-chance to disentangle variations of mental workload
               from variations of acute stress. Both ECG and fNIRS could
               predict mental workload level, the best accuracy resulted from
               the two measures in combination. Stress level could not be
               accurately diagnosed through ECG alone, only with fNIRS or ECG

               since stress classification was more accurate for those with
               higher subjective state anxiety, perhaps due to a greater
               sensitivity to stress. Mental workload and stress were both
               better classified with activity in lateral prefrontal regions of
               the cortex than the medial areas, and the HbO2 signal generally
               lead to better classification than HHB. The current model

              was designed to guide participants to perform prescribed neck
              movements. The cervical spine kinematics was measured by both the
              Rift and a reference motion tracking system. Comparison of the
              kinematics data between the Rift and the tracking system
              indicated that the Rift can provide good estimates on full range
              of motion (from one side to the other side) during the performed
              task. Because of inertial sensor drifting, the unilateral range
              of motion (from one side to neutral posture) derived from the
              Rift is more erroneous. The root-mean-square errors over a 1-min
              task were within 10° for each rotation axis. The error analysis
              further indicated that the inertial sensor drifted approximately
              6° at the beginning of a trial during the initialization. This
              needs to be addressed when using the Rift in order to more
              accurately measure cervical spine kinematics. It is suggested
              that the front cover of the Rift should be aligned against a
              vertical plane during its initialization.",

               18-20 months, were recorded and analyzed using both

               contained three-axis accelerometers, gyroscopes, and
               magnetometers. Gravitational offset of accelerometer data was
               measured when the sensor was at rest, and removed using sensor
               orientation measured at rest and throughout the reach. Velocity
               was calculated by numeric integration of acceleration, using a
               null-velocity assumption at reach start. Sensor drift was
               neglected given the 1-2s required for a reach. Temporal-spatial

               freshwater-ice season over much of Canada with the reduction
               being mainly attributable to earlier break-ups. These trends
               match those in surface air temperature during the last 50 years.
               Several studies have shown significant relationships between
               Canadian temperature and large-scale atmospheric and oceanic
               oscillations (i.e. teleconnections) particularly, during the
               cold season. However, no investigations have analyzed
               relationships between several teleconnection indices and
               historical freshwater-ice durations over Canada. This paper
               examines the impacts of El Ni{\~n}o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO),
               the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), the Pacific North
               American (PNA) pattern, the North Pacific (NP) index, the North

               Canadian freshwater-ice break/freeze-up dates from 1950--1999.
               Composite and correlation analyses reveal strongest links
               between the Pacific-related PDO, PNA, NP, and ENSO indices and
               ice dates over western Canada. Lakes have stronger and more
               spatially coherent results than rivers, while break-up dates
               have higher correlations as compared to freeze-up. The NAO/AO

              signal components considered as noise, filtering can also result
              in various unintended adverse filter effects (distortions such as
              smoothing) and filter artifacts. METHOD: We give some practical
              guidelines for the evaluation of filter responses (impulse and
              frequency response) and the selection of filter types
              (high-pass/low-pass/band-pass/band-stop; finite/infinite impulse

               components and peaks to a mass-univariate approach in which the

               the number of false positives and correction for multiple

               interact is one of the fundamental mysteries of neuroscience. In
               electrophysiological data, functional connectivity is often
               measured through the consistency of oscillatory phase angles
               between two electrodes placed in or over different brain
               regions. However, due to volume conduction, the results of such
               analyses can be difficult to interpret, because mathematical
               estimates of connectivity can be driven both by true
               inter-regional connectivity, and by volume conduction from the
               same neural source. Generally, there are two approaches to
               attenuate artifacts due to volume conduction: spatial filtering
               in combination with standard connectivity methods, or
               connectivity methods such as the weighted phase lag index that
               are blind to instantaneous connectivity that may reflect volume
               conduction artifacts. The purpose of this paper is to compare
               these two approaches directly in the presence of different
               connectivity time lags (5 or 25 ms) and physiologically
               realistic frequency non-stationarities. The results show that
               standard connectivity methods in combination with Laplacian

               regardless of time lag or changes in frequency, although
               residual volume conduction artifacts were seen in the vicinity
               of the ``seed'' electrode. Weighted phase lag index
               under-estimated connectivity strength at small time lags and
               failed to identify connectivity in the presence of frequency
               mismatches or non-stationarities, but did not misidentify volume
               conduction as ``connectivity.'' Both approaches have strengths
               and limitations, and this paper concludes with practical advice

              Yet no widely used method exists for comparing variability in
              ordered collections of single-trial data epochs across conditions
              and subjects. NEW METHOD: We have developed a method based on an

              or some other measure at each time point in a set of
              event-related single-trial data epochs are represented as color
              coded horizontal lines that are then stacked to form a 2-D

              make otherwise hidden event-related features in the data more

               analysis (ICA) separates data in linearly independent components
               (IC), the classification of these components as artifact or EEG
               signal still requires visual inspection by experts. In this
               paper, we achieve automated artifact elimination using linear
               discriminant analysis (LDA) for classification of feature
               vectors extracted from ICA components via image processing

               range filtering as a feature extraction method with great
               potential for automated IC artifact recognition (accuracy rate

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Electroencephalographic data are easily contaminated
              by signals of non-neural origin. Independent component analysis
              (ICA) can help correct EEG data for such artifacts. Artifact
              independent components (ICs) can be identified by experts via
              visual inspection. But artifact features are sometimes ambiguous
              or difficult to notice, and even experts may disagree about how
              to categorise a particular component. It is therefore important
              to inform users on artifact properties, and give them the
              opportunity to intervene. NEW METHOD: Here we first describe
              artifacts captured by ICA. We review current methods to
              automatically select artifactual components for rejection, and
              introduce the SASICA software, implementing several novel
              selection algorithms as well as two previously described
              automated methods (ADJUST, Mognon et al. Psychophysiology
              2011;48(2):229; and FASTER, Nolan et al. J Neurosci Methods
              2010;48(1):152). RESULTS: We evaluate these algorithms by
              comparing selections suggested by SASICA and other methods to
              manual rejections by experts. The results show that these methods
              can inform observers to improve rejections. However, no automated
              method can accurately isolate artifacts without supervision. The
              comprehensive and interactive plots produced by SASICA therefore
              constitute a helpful guide for human users for making final
              decisions. CONCLUSIONS: Rejecting ICs before EEG data analysis
              unavoidably requires some level of supervision. SASICA offers
              observers detailed information to guide selection of artifact
              ICs. Because it uses quantitative parameters and thresholds, it
              improves objectivity and reproducibility in reporting
              pre-processing procedures. SASICA is also a didactic tool that
              allows users to quickly understand what signal features captured
              by ICs make them likely to reflect artifacts.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Blind source separation techniques have become the
               de facto standard for decomposing electroencephalographic (EEG)
               data. These methods are poorly suited for incorporating prior
               information into the decomposition process. While alternative
               techniques to this problem, such as the use of constrained
               optimization techniques, have been proposed, these alternative
               techniques tend to only minimally satisfy the prior constraints.
               In addition, the experimenter must preset a number of parameters
               describing both this minimal limit as well as the size of the
               target subspaces. NEW METHOD: We propose an informed
               decomposition approach that builds upon the constrained
               optimization approaches for independent components analysis to
               better model and separate distinct subspaces within EEG data. We
               use a likelihood function to adaptively determine the optimal
               model size for each target subspace. RESULTS: Using our method
               we are able to produce ordered independent subspaces that
               exhibit less residual mixing than those obtained with other
               methods. The results show an improvement in modeling specific
               features of the EEG space, while also showing a simultaneous
               reduction in the number of components needed for each model.
               COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD(S): We first compare our
               approach to common methods in the field of EEG decomposition,
               such as Infomax, FastICA, PCA, JADE, and SOBI for the task of
               modeling and removing both EOG and EMG artifacts. We then
               demonstrate the utility of our approach for the more complex
               problem of modeling neural activity. CONCLUSIONS: By working in
               a one-size-fits-all fashion current EEG decomposition methods do
               not adapt to the specifics of each data set and are not well
               designed to incorporate additional information about the
               decomposition problem. However, by adding specific information
               about the problem to the decomposition task, we improve the
               identification and separation of distinct subspaces within the

               to interpretation of EEG and other electrophysiological signals.
               They are often channel-specific and do not fully benefit from
               component analysis techniques such as ICA, and their presence
               reduces the dimensionality needed by those techniques. Their
               high-frequency content may mask or masquerade as gamma band
               cortical activity. NEW METHOD: The sparse time artifact removal
               (STAR) algorithm removes artifacts that are sparse in space and
               time. The time axis is partitioned into an artifact-free and an
               artifact-contaminated part, and the correlation structure of the
               data is estimated from the covariance matrix of the
               artifact-free part. Artifacts are then corrected by projection
               of each channel onto the subspace spanned by the other channels.
               RESULTS: The method is evaluated with both simulated and real
               data, and found to be highly effective in removing or
               attenuating typical channel-specific artifacts. COMPARISON WITH

               trial removal or channel removal or interpolation, very few data
               are lost. In contrast to ICA or other linear techniques,

  abstract = "By formulating Helmholtz's ideas about perception, in terms of
              modern-day theories, one arrives at a model of perceptual
              inference and learning that can explain a remarkable range of
              neurobiological facts: using constructs from statistical physics,
              the problems of inferring the causes of sensory input and
              learning the causal structure of their generation can be resolved
              using exactly the same principles. Furthermore, inference and
              learning can proceed in a biologically plausible fashion. The
              ensuing scheme rests on Empirical Bayes and hierarchical models
              of how sensory input is caused. The use of hierarchical models
              enables the brain to construct prior expectations in a dynamic
              and context-sensitive fashion. This scheme provides a principled
              way to understand many aspects of cortical organisation and
              responses. In this paper, we show these perceptual processes are
              just one aspect of emergent behaviours of systems that conform to
              a free energy principle. The free energy considered here measures
              the difference between the probability distribution of
              environmental quantities that act on the system and an arbitrary
              distribution encoded by its configuration. The system can
              minimise free energy by changing its configuration to affect the
              way it samples the environment or change the distribution it
              encodes. These changes correspond to action and perception
              respectively and lead to an adaptive exchange with the
              environment that is characteristic of biological systems. This
              treatment assumes that the system's state and structure encode an
              implicit and probabilistic model of the environment. We will look
              at the models entailed by the brain and how minimisation of its
              free energy can explain its dynamics and structure.",

               using measurement systems as fNIRS, EEG and PET. METHODS: Three
               independent reviewers undertook an electronic database research
               browsing six databases. The search request consisted of three
               search fields. The first field comprised common methods to
               evaluate brain activity. The second search field comprised
               synonyms for brain responses to movements. The third search
               field comprised synonyms for walking. RESULTS: 48 of an initial
               yield of 1832 papers were reviewed. We found differences in
               cortical activity regarding young vs. old individuals,
               physically fit vs. physically unfit cohorts, healthy people vs.
               patients with neurological diseases, and between simple and

              players of two different skill levels played simple melodies
              using a musical score. During the performance, the auditory
              feedback was occasionally altered. Subjects with early and
              extensive piano training produced a negative ERP component N210,
              which was absent in non-trained players. When subjects listened
              to music that deviated from a corresponding score without playing
              the piece, N210 did not emerge but the imaginary mismatch
              negativity (iMMN) did. Therefore, N210 may reflect a process of
              mismatch between the intended auditory image evoked by motor
              activity, and actual auditory feedback.",

               ironical that the functional and computational role of the motor
               cortex still remains unresolved. A computational understanding
               of the motor cortex equals to understanding what movement
               variables the motor neurons represent (movement representation
               problem) and how such movement variables are computed through
               the interaction with anatomically connected areas (neural
               computation problem). Electrophysiological experiments in the
               20th century demonstrated that the neural activities in motor
               cortex correlated with a number of motor-related and cognitive
               variables, thereby igniting the controversy over movement
               representations in motor cortex. Despite substantial
               experimental efforts, the overwhelming complexity found in
               neural activities has impeded our understanding of how movements
               are represented in the motor cortex. Recent progresses in

              specifically with SPM procedures for the analysis of

              the larger context of integrating electrophysiological and
              hemodynamic measurements of evoked brain responses through the
              fusion of EEG and fMRI data. In this paper, we consider some
              fundamental issues when selecting an appropriate statistical
              model that enables diverse questions to be asked of the data and
              at the same time retains maximum sensitivity. The three key
              issues addressed in this paper are as follows: (i) should
              multivariate or mass univariate analyses be adopted, (ii) should
              time be treated as an experimental factor or as a dimension of
              the measured response variable, and (iii) how to form appropriate
              explanatory variables in a hierarchical observation model. We
              review the relative merits of the different options and explain
              the rationale for our choices. In brief, we motivate a mass
              univariate approach in terms of sensitivity to region-specific
              responses. This involves modeling responses at each voxel or
              space bin separately. In contradistinction, we treat time as an
              experimental factor to enable inferences about temporally
              distributed responses that encompass multiple time bins. In a
              companion paper, we develop statistical models of ERPs in the

              clustering on time/frequency transforms of components returned by
              independent component analysis (ICA). Dipole models of fmtheta
              component scalp maps were consistent with their generation in or
              near dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. From trial to trial, theta
              power of fmtheta components varied widely but correlated
              moderately with theta power in other frontal and left temporal
              processes. The weak mean increase in frontal midline theta power
              with increasing memory load, produced entirely by the fmtheta
              components, largely reflected progressively stronger theta

              to understand interference among different areas. The EEG/MEG
              signals result from the superimposition of underlying brain
              source activities volume conducted through the head. The effects
              of volume conduction produce spurious interactions in the
              measured signals. It is fundamental to separate true source
              interactions from noise and to unmix the contribution of
              different systems composed by interacting sources in order to
              understand interference mechanisms. As a prerequisite, we
              consider the problem of unmixing the contribution of uncorrelated
              sources to a measured field. This problem is equivalent to the
              problem of unmixing the contribution of different uncorrelated
              compound systems composed by interacting sources. To this end, we
              develop a principal component analysis-based method, namely, the
              source principal component analysis (sPCA), which exploits the
              underlying assumption of orthogonality for sources, estimated

              each of the compound systems identified by using sPCA. While the

               identify causality relationships between EEG sources rather than
               between recording sites, most of them need a priori assumptions
               about the cerebral regions involved in the EEG generation. We
               present a novel methodology based on multivariate autoregressive
               (MVAR) modeling and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) able to
               determine the temporal activation of the intracerebral EEG
               sources as well as their approximate locations. The direction of
               synaptic flow between these EEG sources is then estimated using
               the directed transfer function (DTF), and the significance of
               directional coupling strength evaluated with surrogated data.
               The reliability of this approach was assessed with simulations

               different noise sources, and the violation of the
               non-Gaussianity assumption inherent to the proposed technique.
               The simulations showed the superior accuracy of the proposed
               approach over other traditional techniques in most tested

               volunteers under resting conditions. Results suggested that the
               major generation mechanism underlying EEG-alpha oscillations
               consists of a strong bidirectional feedback between thalamus and
               cuneus. The precuneus also seemed to actively participate in the

               significant causal influence neither on the thalamus nor on the

               learning algorithms that have proven useful for the analysis of
               the electroencephalogram (EEG) and magnetoencephalogram (MEG).
               ICA decomposes an EEG/MEG data set into a basis of maximally
               temporally independent components (ICs) that are learned from
               the data. As with any statistic, a concern with using ICA is the
               degree to which the estimated ICs are reliable. An IC may not be
               reliable if ICA was trained on insufficient data, if ICA
               training was stopped prematurely or at a local minimum (for some
               algorithms), or if multiple global minima were present.
               Consequently, evidence of ICA reliability is critical for the
               credibility of ICA results. In this paper, we present a new
               algorithm for assessing the reliability of ICs based on applying
               ICA separately to split-halves of a data set. This algorithm
               improves upon existing methods in that it considers both IC
               scalp topographies and activations, uses a probabilistically
               interpretable threshold for accepting ICs as reliable, and
               requires applying ICA only three times per data set. As evidence
               of the method's validity, we show that the method can perform
               comparably to more time intensive bootstrap resampling and
               depends in a reasonable manner on the amount of training data.
               Finally, using the method we illustrate the importance of
               checking the reliability of ICs by demonstrating that IC
               reliability is dramatically increased by removing the mean EEG

              degrees of freedom, which provides both visual and vestibular
              stimulations to induce motion sickness in a manner that is close
              to that in daily life. Subjects' brain dynamics associated with
              motion sickness were measured using a 32-channel EEG system.
              Their degree of motion sickness was simultaneously and
              continuously reported using an onsite joystick, providing
              non-stop behavioral references to the recorded EEG changes. The
              acquired EEG signals were parsed by independent component
              analysis (ICA) into maximally independent processes. The
              decomposition enables the brain dynamics that are induced by the
              motion of the platform and motion sickness to be disassociated.
              Five MS-related brain processes with equivalent dipoles located
              in the left motor, the parietal, the right motor, the occipital
              and the occipital midline areas were consistently identified
              across all subjects. The parietal and motor components exhibited
              significant alpha power suppression in response to vestibular
              stimuli, while the occipital components exhibited MS-related
              power augmentation in mainly theta and delta bands; the occipital
              midline components exhibited a broadband power increase. Further,
              time series cross-correlation analysis was employed to evaluate
              relationships between the spectral changes associated with
              different brain processes and the degree of motion sickness.
              According to our results, it is suggested both visual and

               electroencephalography (EEG) investigations in the frequency
               domain. EMG is sensitive to a variety of psychological processes
               and can mask genuine effects or masquerade as legitimate
               neurogenic effects across the scalp in frequencies at least as
               low as the alpha band (8-13 Hz). Although several techniques for
               correcting myogenic activity have been described, most are
               subjected to only limited validation attempts. Attempts to gauge
               the impact of EMG correction on intracerebral source models
               (source ``localization'' analyses) are rarer still. Accordingly,
               we assessed the sensitivity and specificity of one prominent
               correction tool, independent component analysis (ICA), on the
               scalp and in the source-space using high-resolution EEG. Data
               were collected from 17 participants while neurogenic and
               myogenic activity was independently varied. Several protocols
               for classifying and discarding components classified as myogenic
               and non-myogenic artifact (e.g., ocular) were systematically
               assessed, leading to the exclusion of one-third to as much as
               three-quarters of the variance in the EEG. Some, but not all, of
               these protocols showed adequate performance on the scalp.
               Indeed, performance was superior to previously validated
               regression-based techniques. Nevertheless, ICA-based EMG
               correction exhibited low validity in the intracerebral
               source-space, likely owing to incomplete separation of
               neurogenic from myogenic sources. Taken with prior work, this
               indicates that EMG artifact can substantially distort estimates
               of intracerebral spectral activity. Neither regression- nor
               ICA-based EMG correction techniques provide complete safeguards
               against such distortions. In light of these results, several
               practical suggestions and recommendations are made for

               the single-trial relationship between neural activity and the

               framework for decoding ERPs, elaborating on linear concepts,

              locomotion lack the temporal resolution necessary to assess
              intra-stride cortical dynamics. Our aim was to determine if
              electrocortical activity is coupled to gait cycle phase during
              steady-speed human walking. We used electroencephalography (EEG),

              and body dynamics while eight healthy young adult subjects walked
              on a treadmill. Infomax independent component analysis (ICA)
              parsed EEG signals into maximally independent component (IC)
              processes representing electrocortical sources, muscle sources,
              and artifacts. We calculated a spatially fixed equivalent current
              dipole for each IC using an inverse modeling approach, and
              clustered electrocortical sources across subjects by similarities
              in dipole locations and power spectra. We then computed
              spectrograms for each electrocortical source that were
              time-locked to the gait cycle. Electrocortical sources in the
              anterior cingulate, posterior parietal, and sensorimotor cortex
              exhibited significant (p<0.05) intra-stride changes in spectral
              power. During the end of stance, as the leading foot was
              contacting the ground and the trailing foot was pushing off,
              alpha- and beta-band spectral power increased in or near the
              left/right sensorimotor and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex.
              Power increases in the left/right sensorimotor cortex were more
              pronounced for contralateral limb push-off (ipsilateral
              heel-strike) than for ipsilateral limb push-off (contralateral
              heel-strike). Intra-stride high-gamma spectral power changes were
              evident in anterior cingulate, posterior parietal, and
              sensorimotor cortex. These data confirm cortical involvement in
              steady-speed human locomotion. Future applications of these

               acquiring multiple modalities of data and searching for task- or
               disease-related changes in each modality separately. A major
               challenge in analysis is to find systematic approaches for
               fusing these differing data types together to automatically find
               patterns of related changes across multiple modalities, when
               they exist. Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is a popular
               unsupervised learning method that can be used to find the modes
               of variation in neuroimaging data across a group of subjects.
               When multimodal data is acquired for the subjects, ICA is
               typically performed separately on each modality, leading to
               incompatible decompositions across modalities. Using a modular
               Bayesian framework, we develop a novel ``Linked ICA'' model for
               simultaneously modelling and discovering common features across
               multiple modalities, which can potentially have completely
               different units, signal- and contrast-to-noise ratios, voxel
               counts, spatial smoothnesses and intensity distributions.
               Furthermore, this general model can be configured to allow
               tensor ICA or spatially-concatenated ICA decompositions, or a
               combination of both at the same time. Linked ICA automatically
               determines the optimal weighting of each modality, and also can
               detect single-modality structured components when present. This
               is a fully probabilistic approach, implemented using Variational

  abstract  = "Neuronal oscillations have been shown to underlie various
               cognitive, perceptual and motor functions in the brain. However,
               studying these oscillations is notoriously difficult with
               EEG/MEG recordings due to a massive overlap of activity from
               multiple sources and also due to the strong background noise.
               Here we present a novel method for the reliable and fast
               extraction of neuronal oscillations from multi-channel
               EEG/MEG/LFP recordings. The method is based on a linear
               decomposition of recordings: it maximizes the signal power at a
               peak frequency while simultaneously minimizing it at the
               neighboring, surrounding frequency bins. Such procedure leads to
               the optimization of signal-to-noise ratio and allows extraction
               of components with a characteristic ``peaky'' spectral profile,
               which is typical for oscillatory processes. We refer to this
               method as spatio-spectral decomposition (SSD). Our simulations
               demonstrate that the method allows extraction of oscillatory
               signals even with a signal-to-noise ratio as low as 1:10. The
               SSD also outperformed conventional approaches based on
               independent component analysis. Using real EEG data we also show
               that SSD allows extraction of neuronal oscillations (e.g., in
               alpha frequency range) with high signal-to-noise ratio and with
               the spatial patterns corresponding to central and
               occipito-parietal sources. Importantly, running time for SSD is
               only a few milliseconds, which clearly distinguishes it from
               other extraction techniques usually requiring minutes or even
               hours of computational time. Due to the high accuracy and speed,

               the brain tissue. The back-reflection geometry of the
               measurement makes the DOI signal strongly contaminated by
               systemic interference occurring in the superficial layers. A
               recent development has been the use of signals from small
               source-detector separation (1cm) optodes as regressors. Since
               those additional measurements are mainly sensitive to
               superficial layers in adult humans, they help in removing the
               systemic interference present in longer separation measurements
               (3 cm). Encouraged by those findings, we developed a dynamic
               estimation procedure to remove global interference using small

               reconstructing agonist and antagonist muscle activities (i.e.
               filtered electromyography (EMG) signals) from EEG cortical
               currents estimated using a hierarchical Bayesian EEG inverse
               method. Results of 5 volunteer subjects performing isometric
               right wrist flexion and extension tasks showed that individual
               muscle activity time series, as well as muscle activities at

  abstract  = "EEG (electroencephalography) has been used for decades in
               thousands of research studies and is today a routine clinical
               tool despite the small magnitude of measured scalp potentials.
               It is widely accepted that the currents originating in the brain
               are strongly influenced by the high resistivity of skull bone,
               but it is less well known that the thin layer of CSF
               (cerebrospinal fluid) has perhaps an even more important effect
               on EEG scalp magnitude by spatially blurring the signals. Here
               it is shown that brain shift and the resulting small changes in
               CSF layer thickness, induced by changing the subject's position,
               have a significant effect on EEG signal magnitudes in several
               standard visual paradigms. For spatially incoherent
               high-frequency activity the effect produced by switching from
               prone to supine can be dramatic, increasing occipital signal
               power by several times for some subjects (on average 80\%). MRI
               measurements showed that the occipital CSF layer between the
               brain and skull decreases by approximately 30\% in thickness
               when a subject moves from prone to supine position. A multiple
               dipole model demonstrated that this can indeed lead to occipital
               EEG signal power increases in the same direction and order of
               magnitude as those observed here. These results suggest that
               future EEG studies should control for subjects' posture, and
               that some studies may consider placing their subjects into the
               most favorable position for the experiment. These findings also
               imply that special consideration should be given to EEG
               measurements from subjects with brain atrophy due to normal
               aging or neurodegenerative diseases, since the resulting

               of available channels and samples, as well as more exploratory
               experimental designs, it has become necessary to develop a
               statistical process with a high level of statistical integrity,
               signal sensitivity which nonetheless produces results which are
               interpretable to the common user. Threshold-free
               cluster-enhancement has recently been proposed as a useful
               analysis tool for fMRI datasets. This approach essentially takes
               into account both a data point's statistical intensity and
               neighbourhood to transform the original signal into a more
               intuitive understanding of 'real' differences between groups or
               conditions. Here we adapt this approach to optimally deal with
               EEG datasets and use permutation-based statistics to build an
               efficient statistical analysis. Furthermore we compare the
               results with several other non-parametric and parametric

               sensitive to the variety of signal types common to EEG datasets
               without the need for any arbitrary adjusting of parameters.
               Moreover, a unique p-value is produced for each channel-sample

              power of the components may be related to the target variable. In
              this paper we show that these standard approaches are suboptimal
              as the first does not take into account the superposition of many
              sources due to volume conduction, while the second is unable to
              exploit available information about the target variable. To
              improve upon these approaches we introduce a novel (supervised)
              source separation framework called Source Power Comodulation
              (SPoC). SPoC makes use of the target variable in the
              decomposition process in order to give preference to components
              whose power comodulates with the target variable. We present two
              algorithms that implement the SPoC approach. Using simulations
              with a realistic head model, we show that the SPoC algorithms are
              able extract neuronal components exhibiting high correlation of
              power with the target variable. In this task, the SPoC algorithms
              outperform other commonly used techniques that are based on the
              sensor data or ICA approaches. Furthermore, using real
              electroencephalography (EEG) recordings during an auditory steady
              state paradigm, we demonstrate the utility of the SPoC algorithms
              by extracting neuronal components exhibiting high correlation of
              power with the intensity of the auditory input. Taking into
              account the results of the simulations and real EEG recordings,
              we conclude that SPoC represents an adequate approach for the
              optimal extraction of neuronal components showing coupling of
              power with continuously changing behaviorally relevant
              parameters.",

              of electrocortical signals (e.g., electroencephalogram [EEG] and
              magnetoencephalogram) reflect important aspects of sensory,
              motor, and cognitive cortical processing. The detection of ERD
              and ERS relies on time-frequency decomposition of single-trial
              electrocortical signals, to identify significant stimulus-induced
              changes in power within specific frequency bands. Typically,
              these changes are quantified by expressing post-stimulus EEG
              power as a percentage of change relative to pre-stimulus EEG
              power. However, expressing post-stimulus EEG power relative to
              pre-stimulus EEG power entails two important and surprisingly
              neglected issues. First, it can introduce a significant bias in
              the estimation of ERD/ERS magnitude. Second, it confuses the
              contribution of pre- and post-stimulus EEG power. Taking the
              human electrocortical responses elicited by transient nociceptive
              stimuli as an example, we demonstrate that expressing ERD/ERS as
              the average percentage of change calculated at single-trial level
              introduces a positive bias, resulting in an overestimation of ERS
              and an underestimation of ERD. This bias can be avoided using a
              single-trial baseline subtraction approach. Furthermore, given
              that the variability in ERD/ERS is not only dependent on the
              variability in post-stimulus power but also on the variability in
              pre-stimulus power, an estimation of the respective contribution
              of pre- and post-stimulus EEG variability is needed. This can be
              achieved using a multivariate linear regression (MVLR) model,
              which could be optimally estimated using partial least square
              (PLS) regression, to dissect and quantify the relationship
              between behavioral variables and pre- and post-stimulus EEG
              activities. In summary, combining single-trial baseline
              subtraction approach with PLS regression can be used to achieve a
              correct detection and quantification of ERD/ERS.",

               separate cognitive tasks and 64 subjects in which EEG and EMG
               (muscle activity from the thumb used to respond) were recorded.
               In typical neuroscience experiments, behavioral responses are
               classified as ``error'' or ``correct''; however, closer
               inspection of our data revealed that correct responses were
               often accompanied by ``partial errors'' - a muscle twitch of the
               incorrect hand (``mixed correct trials,'' ~13\% of the trials).
               We found that these muscle twitches dissociated conflicts from
               errors in time-frequency domain analyses of EEG data. In
               particular, both mixed-correct trials and full error trials were
               associated with enhanced theta-band power (4-9Hz) compared to
               correct trials. However, full errors were additionally
               associated with power and frontal-parietal synchrony in the

               revealed a significant modulation of theta power as a function
               of partial error correction time, thus linking trial-to-trial
               fluctuations in power to conflict. Furthermore, single-trial
               correlation analyses revealed a qualitative dissociation between
               conflict and error processing, such that mixed correct trials
               were associated with positive theta-RT correlations whereas full
               error trials were associated with negative delta-RT

              these methods with respect to the cognitive processes under
              study. Here we discuss which methods allow for such
              interpretations, and provide guidelines for choosing an
              appropriate analysis for a given experimental goal: For a surgeon
              who needs to decide where to remove brain tissue it is most
              important to determine the origin of cognitive functions and
              associated neural processes. In contrast, when communicating with
              paralyzed or comatose patients via brain-computer interfaces, it
              is most important to accurately extract the neural processes
              specific to a certain mental state. These equally important but
              complementary objectives require different analysis methods.
              Determining the origin of neural processes in time or space from
              the parameters of a data-driven model requires what we call a
              forward model of the data; such a model explains how the measured
              data was generated from the neural sources. Examples are general
              linear models (GLMs). Methods for the extraction of neural
              information from data can be considered as backward models, as
              they attempt to reverse the data generating process. Examples are
              multivariate classifiers. Here we demonstrate that the parameters
              of forward models are neurophysiologically interpretable in the
              sense that significant nonzero weights are only observed at
              channels the activity of which is related to the brain process
              under study. In contrast, the interpretation of backward model
              parameters can lead to wrong conclusions regarding the spatial or
              temporal origin of the neural signals of interest, since
              significant nonzero weights may also be observed at channels the
              activity of which is statistically independent of the brain
              process under study. As a remedy for the linear case, we propose
              a procedure for transforming backward models into forward models.
              This procedure enables the neurophysiological interpretation of
              the parameters of linear backward models. We hope that this work
              raises awareness for an often encountered problem and provides a
              theoretical basis for conducting better interpretable

               performed in sensor space, disregarding the mixing effects
               implied by volume conduction and confounding noise. While the

               source space representations of the multivariate data or on the
               effect of noise. Such differences, if not duly acknowledged, may
               lead to erroneous data interpretations. We show in simulations

               lead to an incomplete picture of the LRTC properties of the

               estimate of the Hurst exponent of the underlying signal.
               Moreover, these predictions are confirmed in real data, where we
               analyze the amplitude dynamics of neuronal oscillations in the

               algorithms and signal-to-noise ratios. In all these simulations
               SSD invariably outperformed PCA often by a large margin.
               Moreover, using a database of multichannel EEG recordings from
               80 subjects we show that pre-processing with SSD significantly
               increases the performance of single-trial classification of
               imagined movements, compared to the classification with PCA
               pre-processing or without any dimensionality reduction. Our
               simulations and analysis of real EEG experiments show that,
               while not being supervised, the SSD algorithm is capable of
               extracting components primarily relating to the signal of
               interest often using as little as 20\% of the data variance,
               instead of > 90\% variance as in case of PCA. Given its ease of
               use, absence of supervision, and capability to efficiently
               reduce the dimensionality of multivariate EEG/MEG data, we
               advocate the application of SSD pre-processing for the analysis
               of spontaneous and induced neuronal oscillations in normal

               situations, including weak sources, bilateral correlated
               sources, multiple sources, and cluster sources. In this
               approach, tomographic maps of sources are obtained by
               back-projection of the ICA mixing coefficients into the
               source-space (3-D brain template). The advantages of
               source-space ICA over the popular alternative approaches of
               sensor-space ICA together with dipole fitting and power mapping
               via minimum-variance beamforming are demonstrated. Simulated EEG

               Source-space ICA is superior to the minimum-variance beamforming

               superior to sensor-space ICA on accuracy of localization of
               sources, as source-space ICA applies ICA to the time-courses of
               voxels reconstructed from minimum-variance beamforming on a 3D
               scanning grid and these time-courses are optimally unmixed via

              data-driven method for parsing brain and non-brain EEG source
              signals, mixed by volume conduction to the scalp electrodes, into
              a set of maximally temporally and often functionally independent
              components (ICs). Many ICs may be identified with a precise
              physiological or non-physiological origin. However, this process
              is hindered by partial instability in ICA results that can arise
              from noise in the data. Here we propose RELICA (RELiable ICA), a
              novel method to characterize IC reliability within subjects.
              RELICA first computes IC ``dipolarity'' a measure of
              physiological plausibility, plus a measure of IC consistency
              across multiple decompositions of bootstrap versions of the input
              data. RELICA then uses these two measures to visualize and
              cluster the separated ICs, providing a within-subject measure of
              IC reliability that does not involve checking for its occurrence
              across subjects. We demonstrate the use of RELICA on EEG data
              recorded from 14 subjects performing a working memory experiment
              and show that many brain and ocular artifact ICs are correctly
              classified as ``stable'' (highly repeatable across decompositions
              of bootstrapped versions of the input data). Many stable ICs
              appear to originate in the brain, while other stable ICs account
              for identifiable non-brain processes such as line noise. RELICA
              might be used with any linear blind source separation algorithm

               magnetoencephalographic (EEG/MEG) signals have been linked to a
               wide range of brain functions. To date, most of the evidence is
               obtained by correlating bandpower fluctuations to specific
               target variables such as reaction times or task ratings, while
               the causal links between oscillatory activity and behavior
               remain less clear. Here, we propose to identify causal
               relationships by the statistical concept of Granger causality,
               and we investigate which methods are bests suited to reveal
               Granger causal links between the power of brain oscillations and
               experimental variables. As an alternative to testing such causal
               links on the sensor level, we propose to linearly combine the
               information contained in each sensor in order to create virtual
               channels, corresponding to estimates of underlying brain
               oscillations, the Granger-causal relations of which may be
               assessed. Such linear combinations of sensor can be given by
               source separation methods such as, for example, Independent
               Component Analysis (ICA) or by the recently developed Source
               Power Correlation (SPoC) method. Here we compare Granger causal
               analysis on power dynamics obtained from i) sensor directly, ii)
               spatial filtering methods that do not optimize for Granger
               causality (ICA and SPoC), and iii) a method that directly
               optimizes spatial filters to extract sources the power dynamics
               of which maximally Granger causes a given target variable. We
               refer to this method as Granger Causal Power Analysis
               (GrangerCPA). Using both simulated and real EEG recordings, we
               find that computing Granger causality on channel-wise spectral
               power suffers from a poor signal-to-noise ratio due to volume
               conduction, while all three multivariate approaches alleviate
               this issue. In real EEG recordings from subjects performing
               self-paced foot movements, all three multivariate methods
               identify neural oscillations with motor-related patterns at a
               similar performance level. In an auditory perception task, the
               application of GrangerCPA reveals significant Granger-causal

              detected when single-trial waveforms are analysed in the
              time-frequency domain, and consist in stimulus-induced decreases

              (event-related synchronization, ERS) of synchrony in the activity
              of the underlying neuronal populations. ERD and ERS reflect
              changes in the parameters that control oscillations in neuronal
              networks and, depending on the frequency at which they occur,
              represent neuronal mechanisms involved in cortical activation,

               approaches. In this work, we applied high-density EEG source
               imaging based on individual anatomy to enable neuroimaging
               during walking. To minimize the impact of muscular influence on
               EEG recordings we introduce a novel artifact correction method
               based on spectral decomposition. High $\gamma$ oscillations
               (>60Hz) were previously reported to play an important role in
               motor control. Here, we investigate high $\gamma$ amplitudes
               while focusing on two different aspects of a walking experiment,
               namely the fact that a person walks and the rhythmicity of
               walking. We found that high $\gamma$ amplitudes (60-80Hz),
               located focally in central sensorimotor areas, were
               significantly increased during walking compared to standing.
               Moreover, high $\gamma$ (70-90Hz) amplitudes in the same areas
               are modulated in relation to the gait cycle. Since the spectral
               peaks of high $\gamma$ amplitude increase and modulation do not
               match, it is plausible that these two high $\gamma$ elements
               represent different frequency-specific network interactions.
               Interestingly, we found high $\gamma$ (70-90Hz) amplitudes to be
               coupled to low $\gamma$ (24-40Hz) amplitudes, which both are
               modulated in relation to the gait cycle but conversely to each

               pinpointing the region-specific frequency band oscillations that
               are associated with specific parameters of movement during the
               acceleration and deceleration phases. We report a study using 3D

               examines electrocortical dynamics while participants produce
               upper limb movements to different distances at varying rates.
               During fast ballistic movements, we observed increased theta
               band activity in the left motor area contralateral to the moving
               limb during the acceleration phase of the movement, and theta
               power correlated with the acceleration of movement. In contrast,
               beta band activity scaled with the type of movement during the

               source representation. Our method assumes that only a small
               number of brain sources are active throughout a measurement,
               where each of the sources exhibits focal (smooth but localized)
               characteristics in space, time and frequency. This structure is
               enforced through an expansion of the source current density into
               appropriate spatio-temporal basis functions in combination with
               sparsity constraints. This approach combines the main strengths
               of two existing methods, namely Sparse Basis Field Expansions
               (Haufe et al., 2011) and Time-Frequency Mixed-Norm Estimates
               (Gramfort et al., 2013). By adjusting the ratio between two
               regularization terms, STOUT is capable of trading temporal for
               spatial reconstruction accuracy and vice versa, depending on the
               requirements of specific analyses and the provided data. Due to
               allowing for non-stationary source activations, STOUT is
               particularly suited for the localization of event-related
               potentials (ERP) and other evoked brain activity. We demonstrate
               its performance on simulated ERP data for varying
               signal-to-noise ratios and numbers of active sources. Our

               allocentric spatial information into the respective other
               spatial reference frame (SRF). While more and more imaging

               (EEG) are missing. To investigate the function of the RSC in
               spatial navigation with high temporal resolution we used EEG to
               analyze spectral perturbations during navigation based on
               allocentric and egocentric SRF. Participants performed a path
               integration task in a clearly structured virtual environment
               providing allothetic information. Continuous EEG recordings were
               decomposed by independent component analysis (ICA) with
               subsequent source reconstruction of independent time source
               series using equivalent dipole modeling. Time-frequency
               transformation was used to investigate reference frame-specific
               orientation processes during navigation as compared to a control
               condition with identical visual input but no orientation task.
               Our results demonstrate that navigation based on an egocentric
               reference frame recruited a network including the parietal,
               motor, and occipital cortices with dominant perturbations in the

               synchronization in the 12-14 Hz band in the RSC. The results
               support the claim that the retrosplenial complex is central to
               translating egocentric spatial information into allocentric
               reference frames. Modulations in different frequencies with
               different time courses in the RSC further provide first evidence

              i.e., the avatar movement did not match the participant's
              movement. Self-generated real errors and false (avatar) errors
              showed very different ERP signatures and with different
              processing latencies: while real errors showed a classical
              frontal-central error-related negativity (Ne/ERN), peaking 100ms
              after error commission, false errors elicited a larger and
              delayed parietal negative component (at about 350-400ms). The
              violation of the sense of agency elicited by false avatar errors
              showed a strong similarity to ERP signatures related to semantic

              This experimental situation did not elicit the N400 component

              unexpected tactile sensations can herald events of motivational

              hedonic rewards (e.g., a caressing touch). Awareness of such
              events is thought to depend upon the hierarchical integration of
              body-related mismatch responses by the anterior insula. To
              investigate this possibility, we measured brain activity using
              functional magnetic resonance imaging, while healthy participants

               level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI recordings of macaque monkeys under
               general anesthesia and in human subjects under resting-state
               conditions. We mainly focus on sliding-window correlations since
               these are most widely used in assessing dFC, but also consider a
               recently proposed non-linear measure. The simulations and
               methodology, however, are general and can be applied to any
               measure. The results are twofold. First, through simulations, we
               show that in typical resting-state sessions of 10 min, it is
               almost impossible to detect dFC using sliding-window
               correlations. This prediction is validated by both the macaque
               and the human data: in none of the individual recording sessions
               was evidence for dFC found. Second, detection power can be
               considerably increased by session- or subject-averaging of the
               measures. In doing so, we found that most of the functional
               connections are in fact dynamic. With this study, we hope to
               raise awareness of the statistical pitfalls in the assessment of
               dFC and how they can be avoided by using appropriate statistical
               methods.",

               as well as in targeted transcranial electric current stimulation
               (tES), a volume conductor model is required to describe the flow
               of electric currents in the head. Boundary element models (BEM)
               can be readily computed to represent major tissue compartments,
               but cannot encode detailed anatomical information within
               compartments. Finite element models (FEM) can capture more
               tissue types and intricate anatomical structures, but with the
               higher precision also comes the need for semi-automated
               segmentation, and a higher computational cost. In either case,
               adjusting to the individual human anatomy requires costly
               magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and thus head modeling is
               often based on the anatomy of an 'arbitrary' individual (e.g.
               Colin27). Additionally, existing reference models for the human
               head often do not include the cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF), and
               their field of view excludes portions of the head and neck-two
               factors that demonstrably affect current-flow patterns. Here we
               present a highly detailed FEM, which we call ICBM-NY, or ``New
               York Head''. It is based on the ICBM152 anatomical template (a
               non-linear average of the MRI of 152 adult human brains) defined
               in MNI coordinates, for which we extended the field of view to
               the neck and performed a detailed segmentation of six tissue
               types (scalp, skull, CSF, gray matter, white matter, air
               cavities) at 0.5mm(3) resolution. The model was solved for 231
               electrode locations. To evaluate its performance, additional
               FEMs and BEMs were constructed for four individual subjects.
               Each of the four individual FEMs (regarded as the 'ground
               truth') is compared to its BEM counterpart, the ICBM-NY, a BEM
               of the ICBM anatomy, an 'individualized' BEM of the ICBM anatomy
               warped to the individual head surface, and FEMs of the other
               individuals. Performance is measured in terms of EEG source
               localization and tES targeting errors. Results show that the
               ICBM-NY outperforms FEMs of mismatched individual anatomies as
               well as the BEM of the ICBM anatomy according to both criteria.
               We therefore propose the New York Head as a new standard head
               model to be used in future EEG and tES studies whenever an
               individual MRI is not available. We release all model data

               alterations that result from brain disorders. One widely used
               method of capturing the dynamics of functional connectivity is
               sliding window correlation (SWC). However, in the absence of a
               ``gold standard'' for comparison, evaluating the performance of
               the SWC in typical resting-state data is challenging. This study
               uses simulated networks (SNs) with known transitions to examine
               the effects of parameters such as window length, window offset,
               window type, noise, filtering, and sampling rate on the SWC
               performance. The SWC time course was calculated for all node
               pairs of each SN and then clustered using the k-means algorithm
               to determine how resulting brain states match known
               configurations and transitions in the SNs. The outcomes show
               that the detection of state transitions and durations in the SWC
               is most strongly influenced by the window length and offset,
               followed by noise and filtering parameters. The effect of the
               image sampling rate was relatively insignificant. Tapered
               windows provide less sensitivity to state transitions than
               rectangular windows, which could be the result of the sharp
               transitions in the SNs. Overall, the SWC gave poor estimates of
               correlation for each brain state. Clustering based on the SWC
               time course did not reliably reflect the underlying state
               transitions unless the window length was comparable to the state

               varies according to the phase of a lower frequency. Here, we
               show that this rule extends to brain-organ interactions. We

               generated by the stomach - the gastric basal rhythm - using
               electrogastrography, and spontaneous brain dynamics with

               found significant phase-amplitude coupling between the
               infra-slow gastric phase and the amplitude of the cortical alpha
               rhythm (10-11Hz), with gastric phase accounting for 8\% of the

               areas. Oscillatory activity within the beta-band (13-30Hz) has
               been suggested to provide distinct functional roles for
               attention and sensorimotor control, yet it remains unclear how
               beta-band and other oscillatory activity within and between
               cortical regions is coordinated to enhance motor performance. We
               explore this open issue by simultaneously measuring high-density
               cortical activity and elbow flexor and extensor neuromuscular
               activity during ballistic movements, and manipulating error
               using high and low visual gain across three target distances.
               Compared with low visual gain, high visual gain decreased
               movement errors at each distance. Group analyses in 3D
               source-space revealed increased theta-, alpha-, and beta-band
               desynchronization of the contralateral motor cortex and medial
               parietal cortex in high visual gain conditions and this
               corresponded to reduced movement error. Dynamic causal modeling
               was used to compute connectivity between motor cortex and
               parietal cortex. Analyses revealed that gain affected the
               directionally-specific connectivity across broadband frequencies
               from parietal to sensorimotor cortex but not from sensorimotor
               cortex to parietal cortex. These new findings provide support
               for the interpretation that broad-band oscillations in theta,
               alpha, and beta frequency bands within sensorimotor and parietal
               cortex coordinate to facilitate accurate upper limb movement.
               SUMMARY STATEMENT: Our findings establish a link between
               sensorimotor oscillations in the context of online motor
               performance in common source space across subjects.
               Specifically, the extent and distinct role of medial parietal

  abstract  = "We take the feeling that our body belongs to us for granted.
               However, recent research has shown that it is possible to alter
               the subjective sensation of body ownership (BO) by manipulating
               multisensory bodily inputs. Several frontal and parietal regions
               are known to specifically process multisensory cues presented
               close to the body, i.e., within the peripersonal space (PPS). It
               has been proposed that these PPS fronto-parietal regions also
               underlie BO. However, most previous studies investigated the
               brain mechanisms of either BO or of PPS processing separately
               and by using a variety of paradigms. Here, we conducted an
               extensive meta-analysis of functional neuroimaging studies to
               investigate PPS and BO processing in humans in order to: a)
               assess quantitatively where each one of these functions was
               individually processed in the brain; b) identify whether and
               where these processes shared common or engaged distinct brain
               mechanisms; c) characterize these areas in terms of whole-brain
               co-activation networks and functions, respectively. We
               identified (i) a bilateral PPS network including superior
               parietal, temporo-parietal and ventral premotor regions and (ii)
               a BO network including posterior parietal cortex (right
               intraparietal sulcus, IPS; and left IPS and superior parietal
               lobule, SPL), right ventral premotor cortex, and the left
               anterior insula. Co-activation maps related to both PPS and BO
               encompassed largely overlapping fronto-parietal networks, but
               whereas the PPS network was more frequently associated with
               sensorimotor tasks, the BO network was rather associated with
               attention and awareness tasks. Finally, the conjunction analysis
               showed that (iii) PPS and BO tasks anatomically overlapped only
               in two clusters located in the left parietal cortex (dorsally at
               the intersection between the SPL, the IPS and area 2 and
               ventrally between areas 2 and IPS). Distinct activations were
               located for PPS at the temporo-parietal junction and for BO in
               the anterior insula. These results in PPS and BO and provide
               evidence-based insight about the overlap of the two processes in
               the IPS region and the extensive connectivity between the two
               associated co-activation networks. They also show significant
               dissociations, with PPS fronto-parietal areas located more
               proximal to the central sulcus than BO areas. Such anatomical
               distinction may also reflect the different functions of the two
               processes, whereby PPS areas underlie a multisensory-motor
               interface for body-objects interaction and BO areas being
               involved in bodily awareness and self-consciousness.",

              two decades to investigate functional connectivity (FC), i.e. the
              functional interplay between different regions of the brain,
              which was for a long time assumed to have stationary nature. Only
              recently was the dynamic behaviour of FC revealed, showing that

              fluctuations, connectivity between different brain regions

              has been directed to assessing and characterising dynamic FC
              (dFC), and several different approaches were explored to identify
              relevant FC fluctuations. At the same time, several questions
              were raised about the nature of dFC, which would be of interest

              preprocessing phase that attempts to remove them or minimize
              their impact. This paper offers a set of useful techniques for
              this purpose: robust detrending, robust rereferencing, outlier
              detection, data interpolation (inpainting), step removal, and
              filter ringing artifact removal. These techniques provide a less

              and they are relatively immune to artifacts that disrupt
              alternative approaches such as filtering. Robust detrending
              allows slow drifts and common mode signals to be factored out
              while avoiding the deleterious effects of glitches. Robust
              rereferencing reduces the impact of artifacts on the reference.
              Inpainting allows corrupt data to be interpolated from intact
              parts based on the correlation structure estimated over the
              intact parts. Outlier detection allows the corrupt parts to be
              identified. Step removal fixes the high-amplitude flux jump
              artifacts that are common with some MEG systems. Ringing removal
              allows the ringing response of the antialiasing filter to
              glitches (steps, pulses) to be suppressed. The performance of the

               using a mass-univariate model, equivalent to fitting a linear
               model at every voxel with a known set of covariates. Due to the
               large number of linear models, it is challenging to check if the
               selection of covariates is appropriate and to modify this
               selection adequately. The use of standard diagnostics, such as
               residual plotting, is clearly not practical for neuroimaging
               data. However, the selection of covariates is crucial for linear
               regression to ensure valid statistical inference. In particular,
               the mean model of regression needs to be reasonably well
               specified. Unfortunately, this issue is often overlooked in the
               field of neuroimaging. This study aims to adopt the existing
               Confounder Adjusted Testing and Estimation (CATE) approach and
               to extend it for use with neuroimaging data. We propose a

               control but does not strictly reflect the specific use of
               control. In this study, we assessed frontal theta responses that
               underpinned the switch cost in task switching - a specific index
               of cognitive control that does not rely exclusively on RT
               slowing. Here, we utilised a single-trial regression approach to
               assess 1) how cognitive control demands beyond simple RT slowing
               were linked to midfrontal theta and 2) whether midfrontal theta
               effects remained stable over time. In a large cohort that
               included a longitudinal subsample, we found that midfrontal
               theta was modulated by switch costs, with enhanced theta power
               when preparing to switch vs. repeating a task. These effects
               were reliable after a two-year interval (Cronbach's
               $\alpha$.39-0.74). In contrast, we found that trial-by-trial
               modulations of midfrontal theta power predicted the size of the
               switch cost - so that switch trials with increased theta
               produced smaller switch costs. Interestingly, these
               relationships between theta and behaviour were less stable over
               time (Cronbach's $\alpha$ 0-0.61), with participants first using
               both delta and theta bands to influence behaviour whereas after
               two years only theta associations with behaviour remained.
               Together, these findings suggest midfrontal theta supports the
               need for control beyond simple RT slowing and reveal that

              significance are based on an often implicit assumption: In the
              absence of experimental manipulation, the spectral content of any
              given EEG- or MEG-recorded neural oscillator remains
              approximately stationary over the course of a typical
              experimental session (∼1 h), spontaneously fluctuating only
              around its dominant frequency. Here, we examined this assumption
              for ongoing neural oscillations in the alpha-band (8-13 Hz). We
              found that alpha peak frequency systematically decreased over
              time, while alpha-power increased. Intriguingly, these systematic
              changes showed partial independence of each other: Statistical
              source separation (independent component analysis) revealed that
              while some alpha components displayed concomitant power increases

               neuroscientific research to date examines recognition in absence
               of the detailed contextual information that is known to be a
               defining characteristic. Given the importance of environmental
               context for episodic memory, examining ERP correlates of memory
               in more naturalistic settings is vital for progress in
               understanding how retrieval operates in daily life. The current
               study capitalized on recent advances in mobile EEG technology to
               address this issue and is the first to investigate ERP
               correlates of episodic retrieval in real world contexts.
               Participants were guided around a pre-defined route inside a
               building on campus, while performing a recognition memory task,
               which paired images of objects with actual physical locations in
               the building to provide context. Importantly, the findings
               clearly demonstrate that it is possible to observe reliable
               neural correlates of memory in real world contexts. Replicating
               two well established ERP correlates of episodic retrieval
               reported in prior laboratory based studies, we detected FN400
               old/new effects traditionally associated with familiarity
               between 300 and 500 ms, and a late posterior negativity (LPN)
               often linked to reconstructive processing or evaluation of
               retrieval outcomes between 500 and 800 ms. Moreover, the FN400
               effect was found to be sensitive to retrieval of context, with
               more sustained effects for objects encountered in a different
               context at study and test. Overall, the current work highlights
               the power of mobile EEG technology for examining complex
               cognitive functions in more naturalistic real world settings.",

              employs scalp-mounted optically-pumped magnetometers (OPMs) to

              signals from real-world scenarios, artifact rejection is
              essential. However, currently there exists no gold-standard.
              Although a plenitude of methodological approaches implicitly
              assume the presence of latent processes in the signals, elaborate
              Blind-Source-Separation methods have rarely been applied. A
              reason are challenging characteristics such as Non-instantaneous
              and non-constant coupling, correlated noise and statistical
              dependencies between signal components. We present a novel
              suitable BSS framework that tackles these issues by incorporating
              A) Independent Component Analysis methods that exploit both
              higher order statistics and sample dependency, B) multimodality,
              i.e., fNIRS with accelerometer signals, and C)
              Canonical-Correlation Analysis with temporal embedding. This
              enables analysis of signal components and rejection of
              motion-induced physiological hemodynamic artifacts that would
              otherwise be hard to identify. We implement a method for Blind
              Source Separation and Accelerometer based Artifact Rejection and
              Detection (BLISSA2RD). It allows the analysis of a novel n-back
              based cognitive workload paradigm in freely moving subjects, that
              is also presented in this manuscript. We evaluate on the
              corresponding data set and simulated ground truth data, making
              use of metrics based on 1st and 2nd order statistics and SNR and
              compare with three established methods: PCA, Spline and
              Wavelet-based artifact removal. Across 17 subjects, the method is
              shown to reduce movement induced artifacts by up to two orders of
              magnitude, improves the SNR of continuous hemodynamic signals in
              single channels by up to 10dB, and significantly outperforms
              conventional methods in the extraction of simulated Hemodynamic
              Response Functions from strongly contaminated data. The framework

              Classical studies suggested that the RP starts before intention
              is consciously accessed as measured by offline recall-based
              reports, yet the interpretation of the RP and its temporal
              relation to awareness of intention remain controversial. We

              occurs when no action is produced. Recent theories suggest the RP
              reflects the average of accumulated stochastic fluctuations in
              neural activity, rather than a specific signal related to
              self-initiated action: RP-like events should then be widely
              present, even in the absence of actions. We investigated this
              hypothesis by searching for RP-like events in background EEG of
              an appropriate dataset for which the action-locked EEG had
              previously been analysed to test other hypotheses [Khalighinejad,
              N., Brann, E., Dorgham, A., Haggard, P. Dissociating cognitive
              and motoric precursors of human self-initiated action. Journal of
              Cognitive Neuroscience. 2019, 1-14]. We used the actual mean RP
              as a template, and searched the entire epoch for similar neural
              signals, using similarity metrics that capture the temporal or
              spatial properties of the RP. Most EEG epochs contained a number
              of events that were similar to the true RP, but did not lead
              directly to any voluntary action. However, these RP-like events
              were equally common in epochs that eventually terminated in
              voluntary actions as in those where voluntary actions were not
              permitted. Events matching the temporal profile of the RP were
              also a poor match for the spatial profile, and vice versa. We
              conclude that these events are false positives, and do not
              reflect the same mechanism as the RP itself. Finally, applying
              the same template-search algorithm to simulated EEG data
              synthesized from different noise distributions showed that
              RP-like events will occur in any dataset containing the 1⁄f noise
              ubiquitous in EEG recordings. To summarise, we found no evidence
              of genuinely RP-like events at any time other than immediately
              prior to self-initiated actions. Our findings do not support a
              purely stochastic model of RP generation, and suggest that the RP
              may be a specific precursor of self-initiated voluntary actions.",

               between reaction time and theta power) were theta
               phase-dependent in a subject-specific manner, and these
               ``behaviorally optimal'' theta phases were also associated with
               fronto-parietal cross-frequency dynamics emerging as theta
               phase-locked beta power bursts. These effects were present

              the incoming sensory inputs (i.e., prediction errors). Notably,
              prediction errors are weighted depending on precision of prior
              information. However, it remains unclear whether and how the
              brain monitors prior precision when minimising prediction errors
              in different contexts. The current study used
              magnetoencephalography (MEG) to address this question. We
              presented participants with repetition of two non-predicted
              probes embedded in context of high and low precision, namely
              mispredicted and unpredicted probes. Non-parametric permutation

               asymmetries underlying the control of attention. In general
               support of these theories, previous EEG/MEG studies have shown
               that spatial attention is associated with hemispheric modulation
               of posterior alpha power (gating by inhibition). However, since
               measures of alpha power are typically expressed as
               lateralization scores, or collapsed across left and right
               attention shifts, the individual hemispheric contribution to the
               attentional control mechanism remains unclear. This is, however,
               the most crucial and decisive aspect in which the currently
               competing attention theories continue to disagree. To resolve
               this long-standing conflict, we derived predictions regarding
               alpha power modulations from Heilman's hemispatial theory and
               Kinsbourne's interhemispheric competition theory and tested them
               empirically in an EEG experiment. We used an attention paradigm
               capable of isolating alpha power modulation in two attentional
               states, namely attentional bias in a neutral cue condition and
               spatial orienting following directional cues. Differential alpha
               modulations were found for both hemispheres across conditions.
               When anticipating peripheral visual targets without preceding
               directional cues (neutral condition), posterior alpha power in
               the left hemisphere was generally lower and more strongly
               modulated than in the right hemisphere, in line with the
               interhemispheric competition theory. Intriguingly, however,
               while alpha power in the right hemisphere was modulated by both,
               cue-directed leftward and rightward attention shifts, the left
               hemisphere only showed modulations by rightward shifts of
               spatial attention, in line with the hemispatial theory. This
               suggests that the two theories may not be mutually exclusive,

              decoding, brain-computer-interfaces (BCI) or biomarker
              development and is facilitated by supervised machine learning.
              Yet, most of the literature is concerned with classification of
              outcomes defined at the event-level. Here, we focus on predicting
              continuous outcomes from M/EEG signal defined at the
              subject-level, and analyze about 600 MEG recordings from Cam-CAN
              dataset and about 1000 EEG recordings from TUH dataset.
              Considering different generative mechanisms for M/EEG signals and
              the biomedical outcome, we propose statistically-consistent
              predictive models that avoid source-reconstruction based on the
              covariance as representation. Our mathematical analysis and
              ground-truth simulations demonstrated that consistent function
              approximation can be obtained with supervised spatial filtering
              or by embedding with Riemannian geometry. Additional simulations
              revealed that Riemannian methods were more robust to model
              violations, in particular geometric distortions induced by
              individual anatomy. To estimate the relative contribution of
              brain dynamics and anatomy to prediction performance, we propose
              a novel model inspection procedure based on biophysical forward
              modeling. Applied to prediction of outcomes at the subject-level,
              the analysis revealed that the Riemannian model better exploited
              anatomical information while sensitivity to brain dynamics was
              similar across methods. We then probed the robustness of the
              models across different data cleaning options. Environmental
              denoising was globally important but Riemannian models were
              strikingly robust and continued performing well even without
              preprocessing. Our results suggest each method has its niche:
              supervised spatial filtering is practical for event-level
              prediction while the Riemannian model may enable simple
              end-to-end learning.",

               The human brain provides a monitoring system that constantly
               controls and adjusts our actions according to our surroundings.
               However, when our brain's predictions about a planned action do
               not match the sensory inputs resulting from that action,
               cognitive conflict occurs. Much is known about cognitive
               conflict in 1D/2D environments; however, less is known about the
               role of movement characteristics associated with cognitive
               conflict in 3D environment. Hence, we devised an object
               selection task in a virtual reality (VR) environment to test how

               From a series of analyses of EEG recordings synchronized with

              have been described in theoretical and empirical studies, yet the
              associated neural correlates remain unclear. Rhythm-based
              accounts of Bayesian predictive coding propose that predictions
              in generative models of perception are represented in alpha (8-12
              Hz) and beta oscillations (13-30 Hz). Updates to predictions are
              driven by prediction errors weighted by precision (inverse
              variance), and are encoded in gamma oscillations (>30 Hz) and
              associated with suppression of beta activity. We tested whether
              state anxiety alters the neural oscillatory activity associated
              with predictions and precision-weighted prediction errors (pwPE)
              during learning. Healthy human participants performed a
              probabilistic reward-based learning task in a volatile
              environment. In our previous work, we described learning
              behaviour in this task using a hierarchical Bayesian model,
              revealing more precise (biased) beliefs about the tendency of the
              reward contingency in state anxiety, consistent with reduced
              learning in this group. The model provided trajectories of
              predictions and pwPEs for the current study, allowing us to
              assess their parametric effects on the time-frequency
              representations of EEG data. Using convolution modelling for
              oscillatory responses, we found that, relative to a control

              fronto-parietal regions during encoding of predictions. No

              of predictions and pwPEs into the reward-based learning domain.
              The results suggest that state anxiety modulates beta-band
              oscillatory correlates of pwPE and predictions in generative

              availability and relative affordability of these devices provide
              a low entry threshold for newcomers to the field of EEG research.
              The large device variety and the at times opaque communication
              from their manufacturers, however, can make it difficult to
              obtain an overview of this hardware landscape. Similarly, given
              the breadth of existing (wireless) EEG knowledge and research, it
              can be challenging to get started with novel ideas. Therefore,
              this paper first provides a list of 48 wireless EEG devices along
              with a number of important-sometimes difficult-to-obtain-features
              and characteristics to enable their side-by-side comparison,
              along with a brief introduction to each of these aspects and how
              they may influence one's decision. Secondly, we have surveyed
              previous literature and focused on 110 high-impact journal
              publications making use of wireless EEG, which we categorized by
              application and analyzed for device used, number of channels,
              sample size, and participant mobility. Together, these provide a
              basis for informed decision making with respect to hardware and
              experimental precedents when considering new, wireless EEG
              devices and research. At the same time, this paper provides
              background material and commentary about pitfalls and caveats
              regarding this increasingly accessible line of research.",

  abstract = "Alpha oscillatory activity is thought to contribute to visual
              expectancy through the engagement of task-relevant occipital
              regions. In early blindness, occipital alpha oscillations are
              systematically reduced, suggesting that occipital alpha depends
              on visual experience. However, it remains possible that alpha
              activity could serve expectancy in non-visual modalities in blind
              people, especially considering that previous research has shown
              the recruitment of the occipital cortex for non-visual
              processing. To test this idea, we used electroencephalography to
              examine whether alpha oscillations reflected a differential
              recruitment of task-relevant regions between expected and
              unexpected conditions in two haptic tasks (texture and shape
              discrimination). As expected, sensor-level analyses showed that
              alpha suppression in parieto-occipital sites was significantly
              reduced in early blind individuals compared with sighted
              participants. The source reconstruction analysis revealed that
              group differences originated in the middle occipital cortex. In
              that region, expected trials evoked higher alpha
              desynchronization than unexpected trials in the early blind group
              only. Our results support the role of alpha rhythms in the
              recruitment of occipital areas in early blind participants, and
              for the first time we show that although posterior alpha activity
              is reduced in blindness, it remains sensitive to expectancy
              factors. Our findings therefore suggest that occipital alpha
              activity is involved in tactile expectancy in blind individuals,
              serving a similar function to visual anticipation in sighted
              populations but switched to the tactile modality. Altogether, our
              results indicate that expectancy-dependent modulation of alpha
              oscillatory activity does not depend on visual experience.
              SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Are posterior alpha oscillations and
              their role in expectancy and anticipation dependent on visual
              experience? Our results show that tactile expectancy can modulate
              posterior alpha activity in blind (but not sighted) individuals
              through the engagement of occipital regions, suggesting that in
              early blindness, alpha oscillations maintain their proposed role
              in visual anticipation but subserve tactile processing. Our
              findings bring a new understanding of the role that alpha
              oscillatory activity plays in blindness, contrasting with the
              view that alpha activity is task unspecific in blind populations.",

               evidence, the answer is straightforward: more samples are
               available with more time. Indeed, the speed and accuracy of such
               decisions are explained by the accumulation of evidence to a

              instrument, performance practice, and on level of expertise. Yet,
              it is not known though whether the style/genre of music might
              shape auditory processing in the brains of musicians. Here, we
              aimed at tackling the role of musical style/genre on modulating
              neural and behavioral responses to changes in musical features.
              Using a novel, fast and musical sounding multi-feature paradigm,
              we measured the mismatch negativity (MMN), a pre-attentive brain
              response, to six types of musical feature change in musicians
              playing three distinct styles of music (classical, jazz,
              rock/pop) and in non-musicians. Jazz and classical musicians
              scored higher in the musical aptitude test than band musicians
              and non-musicians, especially with regards to tonal abilities.
              These results were extended by the MMN findings: jazz musicians
              had larger MMN-amplitude than all other experimental groups
              across the six different sound features, indicating a greater
              overall sensitivity to auditory outliers. In particular, we found
              enhanced processing of pith and sliding up to pitches in jazz
              musicians only. Furthermore, we observed a more frontal MMN to
              pitch and location compared to the other deviants in jazz
              musicians and left lateralization of the MMN to timbre in
              classical musicians. These findings indicate that the
              characteristics of the style/genre of music played by musicians
              influence their perceptual skills and the brain processing of
              sound features embedded in a musical context. Musicians' brain is
              hence shaped by the type of training, musical style/genre, and
              listening experiences.",

              However, previous studies have focused on sensory perception in
              areas of peripersonal space. The present study investigated
              visual and tactile sensory processing at the goal location of
              upcoming movements towards the body, much of which is not

               illusory perceptions of body ownership. Patients with
               Parkinson's disease (PD), a neurodegenerative disorder
               characterised by striatal dopamine deficiency, are prone to
               illusions and hallucinations and have sensory deficits.
               Dopaminergic treatment also aggravates hallucinations in PD.
               Whether multisensory integration in body ownership is altered by
               PD is unexplored. OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of dopamine
               neurotransmission on illusory perceptions of body ownership.
               METHODS: We studied the Rubber Hand Illusion (RHI) in 21 PD
               patients (on- and off-medication) and 21 controls. In this
               experimental paradigm, synchronous stroking of a rubber hand and
               the subject's hidden real hand results in the illusory
               experience of 'feeling' the rubber hand, and proprioceptive
               mislocalisation of the real hand towards the rubber hand
               ('proprioceptive drift'). Asynchronous stroking typically
               attenuates the RHI. RESULTS: The effect of PD on illusory
               experience depended on the stroking condition (b = -2.15, 95\%
               CI [-3.06, -1.25], p < .0001): patients scored questionnaire
               items eliciting the RHI experience higher than controls in the
               illusion-attenuating (asynchronous) condition, but not in the
               illusion-promoting (synchronous) condition. PD, independent of
               stroking condition, predicted greater proprioceptive drift (b =
               15.05, 95\% CI [6.05, 24.05], p = .0022); the longer the disease
               duration, the greater the proprioceptive drift. However, the RHI
               did not affect subsequent reaching actions. On-medication
               patients scored both illusion (critical) and mock (control)
               questionnaire items higher than when off-medication, an effect
               that increased with disease severity (log (OR) =.014, 95\% CI
               [.01, .02], p < .0001). CONCLUSION: PD affects illusory
               perceptions of body ownership in situations that do not
               typically induce them, implicating dopamine deficit and
               consequent alterations in cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic
               circuitry in multisensory integration. Dopaminergic treatment
               appears to increase suggestibility generally rather than having
               a specific effect on own-body illusions, a novel finding with
               clinical and research implications.",

               this seemingly obvious statement, many accounts of the
               neurobiology underpinning visual perception fail to consider the
               active nature of how we sample our sensory world. This review
               offers an overview of the neurobiology of visual perception,
               which begins with the control of saccadic eye movements.
               Starting from here, we can follow the anatomy backwards, to try
               to understand the functional architecture of neuronal networks
               that support the interrogation of a visual scene. Many of the
               principles encountered in this exercise are equally applicable
               to other perceptual modalities. For example, the somatosensory
               system, like the visual system, requires the sampling of data
               through mobile receptive epithelia. Analysis of a somatosensory
               scene depends on what is palpated, in much the same way that
               visual analysis relies on what is foveated. The discussion here
               is structured around the anatomical systems involved in active
               vision and visual scene construction, but will use these systems

               images and videos of three agents as EEG was recorded: a real

              capitalize on the Immersive Virtual Reality to dissociate vision
              and proprioception by presenting the participants' 3D hand image
              in congruent/incongruent positions with respect to the
              participants' real hand. To measure the hand-centred PPS, we
              exploit multisensory integration occurring when visual stimuli
              are delivered simultaneously with tactile stimuli applied to a
              body district; i.e., visual enhancement of touch (VET).
              Participants are instructed to respond to tactile stimuli while
              ignoring visual stimuli (red LED), which can appear either near
              to or far from the hand receiving tactile (electrical) stimuli.
              The results show that, when vision and proprioception are
              congruent (i.e., real and virtual hand coincide), a
              space-dependent modulation of the VET effect occurs (with faster

              occur near to the real hand and when they occur far from it, but

              the Gratton effect as an index of deployment of attentional
              control. We expected an increase or a decrease in the Gratton
              effect with increase in neural learning depending on whether
              frontal alpha oscillations reflect cortical idling or enhanced
              processing efficiency, respectively. In order to induce
              variability in neural learning beyond natural occurring
              individual differences, we provided half of the participants with
              feedback on alpha amplitude in a 3-dimensional (3D) virtual
              reality environment and the other half received feedback in a 2D
              environment. Our results showed variable neural learning rates,
              with larger rates in the 3D compared to the 2D group,
              corroborating prior evidence of individual differences in
              EEG-based learning and the influence of a virtual environment.
              Regression analyses revealed a significant association between
              the learning rate and changes on deployment of attentional
              control, with larger learning rates being associated with larger
              decreases in the Gratton effect. This association was not
              modulated by feedback medium. The study supports the view of
              frontal alpha oscillations being associated with efficient
              neurocognitive processing and demonstrates the utility of
              neurofeedback training in addressing theoretical questions in the

  abstract = "As we move through our environment, our visual system is
              presented with optic flow, a potentially important cue for
              perception, navigation and postural control. How does the brain
              anticipate the optic flow that arises as a consequence of our own
              movement? Converging evidence suggests that stimuli are processed
              differently by the brain if occurring as a consequence of
              self-initiated actions, compared to when externally generated.
              However, this has mainly been demonstrated with auditory stimuli.
              It is not clear how this occurs with optic flow. We measured
              behavioural, neurophysiological and head motion responses of 29
              healthy participants to radially expanding, vection-inducing
              optic flow stimuli, simulating forward transitional motion, which
              were either initiated by the participant's own button-press
              (``self-initiated flow'') or by the computer (``passive flow'').
              Self-initiation led to a prominent and left-lateralized
              inhibition of the flow-evoked posterior event-related alpha
              desynchronization (ERD), and a stabilisation of postural
              responses. Neither effect was present in control
              button-press-only trials, without optic flow. Additionally,
              self-initiation also produced a large event-related potential
              (ERP) negativity between 130-170 ms after optic flow onset.
              Furthermore, participants' visual induced motion sickness (VIMS)
              and vection intensity ratings correlated positively across the
              group - although many participants felt vection in the absence of
              any VIMS, none reported the opposite combination. Finally, we
              found that the simple act of making a button press leads to a
              detectable head movement even when using a chin rest. Taken
              together, our results indicate that the visual system is capable
              of predicting optic flow when self-initiated, to affect
              behaviour.",

               fronto-parieto-occipital connectivity, and whether this is
               disrupted in ADHD during spatial working memory (SWM)
               performance. We acquired EEG concurrently with fMRI in thirty
               boys (12--16yrs. old, 15 with ADHD), during SWM encoding.
               Psychophysiological connectivity analyses indicated that alpha
               ERD during SWM encoding was associated with both occipital
               activation and fronto-parieto-occipital functional connectivity,
               a finding that expands on prior associations between alpha ERD
               and occipital activation. This finding provides novel support
               for the interpretation of alpha ERD (and the associated changes
               in occipital activation) as a phenomenon that involves, and
               perhaps arises as a result of, top-down network interactions.
               Alpha ERD was associated less strongly with occipital activity,
               but associated more strongly with fronto-parieto-occipital
               connectivity in ADHD, consistent with a compensatory attentional

               resulting changes in non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT)
               likely interact with diet to influence risk for obesity.
               However, previous research on the relationship between diet,
               physical activity, and energy expenditure has been mixed. The
               neuropeptide orexin is a driver of SPA, and orexin neuron
               activity can be manipulated using DREADDs (Designer Receptors
               Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs). We hypothesized that
               HFD decreases SPA and NEAT, and that DREADD-mediated activation
               of orexin neuron signaling would abolish this decrease and
               produce an increase in NEAT instead. To test these ideas, we
               characterized behaviors to determine the extent to which access
               to a high-fat diet (HFD) influences the proportion and
               probability of engaging in food intake and activity. We then
               measured NEAT following access to HFD and following a DREADD
               intervention targeting orexin neurons. Two cohorts of orexin-cre
               male mice were injected with an excitatory DREADD virus into the
               caudal hypothalamus, where orexin neurons are concentrated. Mice
               were then housed in continuous metabolic phenotyping cages
               (Sable Promethion). Food intake, indirect calorimetry, and SPA
               were automatically measured every second. For cohort 1 (n = 8),
               animals were given access to chow, then switched to HFD. For
               cohort 2 (n = 4/group), half of the animals were given access to
               HFD, the other access to chow. Then, among animals on HFD,
               orexin neurons were activated following injections of clozapine
               n-oxide (CNO). Mice on HFD spent significantly less time eating
               (p < 0.01) and more time inactive compared to mice on chow (p <
               0.01). Following a meal, mice on HFD were significantly more
               likely to engage in periods of inactivity compared to those on
               chow (p < 0.05). NEAT was decreased in animals on HFD, and was
               increased to the NEAT level of control animals following
               activation of orexin neurons with DREADDs. Food intake
               (kilocalories) was not significantly different between mice on
               chow and HFD, yet mice on chow expended more energy per unit of
               SPA, relative to that in mice consuming HFD. These results
               suggest that HFD consumption reduces SPA and NEAT, and increases
               inactivity following a meal. Together, the data suggest a change
               in the efficiency of energy expenditure based upon diet, such
               that SPA during HFD burns fewer calories compared to SPA on a

               Motor-specific accounts suggest a parietal subdivision into

               ninety-three healthy males were either assigned to the TSST
               condition or a corresponding control condition in a real or

              to meet the requirements of increased product complexity and
              constant variant updates. A concept to meet challenges within
              this trend, is a close collaboration between human workers and
              robots. Currently, in order to protect human operators, there are
              barriers and restrictions in place which prevent close
              collaboration. This is due to safety systems being mostly
              reactive, rather than anticipating motions or intentions. There
              are probabilistic models, which aim to overcome these
              limitations, yet predicting human behavior remains highly
              complex. Thus, it would be desirable to physically measure
              movement intentions in advance. A novel approach is presented of
              how upper-limb movement intentions can be measured with a mobile
              electroencephalogram (EEG). The human brain constantly analyses
              and evaluates motor movements up to 0.5 s before their execution.
              A safety system could therefore be enhanced to have an early
              warning of an upcoming movement. In order to classify the
              EEG-signals as fast as possible and to minimize fine-tuning
              efforts, a novel data processing methodology is introduced. This
              includes TimeSeriesKMeans labelling of movement intentions, which
              is then used to train a Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural
              Network (LSTM-RNN). The results suggested high detection
              accuracies and potential time gains of up to 513 ms to be
              achieved in a semi-online system. Thus, the time advantages
              included in a simulation demonstrated the potential to increase a

              measure the cortical volume of the left and right anterior and
              posterior insular subdivisions. The subjects included a sample of

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Individuals with schizophrenia demonstrate deficits
              in context processing. These deficits can be characterized by
              examining the influence of auditory context on ERP responses to
              rare target tones. Previous studies demonstrate that target ERP
              deficits in schizophrenia depend on the number of non-targets
              that precede the target ERP. Our goal was to extend these
              findings by examining whether patients with schizophrenia
              demonstrate a reduced sensitivity to subtle differences in the
              auditory context preceding rare target stimuli, as quantified by
              Itti and Baldi's Bayesian prediction error model. METHODS:
              Cortical responses to auditory oddball tones were measured within
              59 individuals with schizophrenia (SZ) and 59 controls (HC).
              Individual trial amplitudes were estimated by conducting group
              ICA on the EEG time series and analyzing the reconstructed
              individual temporal sources. We quantified the auditory context
              of target tones using the Bayesian prediction error model and
              determined whether ERP amplitudes to tones were sensitive to this
              measure of context, or the number of preceding non-targets
              directly, within HC and SZ. RESULTS: Individuals with
              schizophrenia show a significant reduction in ERP response
              amplitudes to targets approximately 244-412 ms following target
              onsets. Individual amplitudes within this window showed
              significantly greater sensitivity to the modeled prediction error
              within the controls than in individuals with schizophrenia. These
              differences approached significance when examining differences in
              amplitudes as a function of the number of preceding non-targets.
              CONCLUSIONS: These findings further clarify differences in HC and

              few studies to physically move human participants with full-body
              motion while recording the brain, most have used EEG due to its
              relative mobility. Past research provides evidence that
              multisensory self-motion perception elicits theta, alpha, and
              beta oscillations. It is important, however, to understand the
              individual contribution of each sense to fully understand how
              these oscillatory frequencies contribute to self-motion

              computational and conceptual simplicity, the representation is
              often sought as a linear transformation of the original data. In

               years. However, most methodological developments have taken
               place locally, resulting in different methodologies among the
               different groups of users.A specific objective of the European
               concerted action SENIAM (surface EMG for a non-invasive
               assessment of muscles) was, besides creating more collaboration
               among the various European groups, to develop recommendations on
               sensors, sensor placement, signal processing and modeling. This
               paper will present the process and the results of the
               development of the recommendations for the SEMG sensors and
               sensor placement procedures. Execution of the SENIAM sensor
               tasks, in the period 1996-1999, has been handled in a number of
               partly parallel and partly sequential activities. A literature
               scan was carried out on the use of sensors and sensor placement
               procedures in European laboratories. In total, 144 peer-reviewed
               papers were scanned on the applied SEMG sensor properties and
               sensor placement procedures. This showed a large variability of
               methodology as well as a rather insufficient description. A
               special workshop provided an overview on the scientific and
               clinical knowledge of the effects of sensor properties and
               sensor placement procedures on the SEMG characteristics. Based
               on the inventory, the results of the topical workshop and
               generally accepted state-of-the-art knowledge, a first proposal
               for sensors and sensor placement procedures was defined. Besides
               containing a general procedure and recommendations for sensor
               placement, this was worked out in detail for 27 different
               muscles. This proposal was evaluated in several European
               laboratories with respect to technical and practical aspects and
               also sent to all members of the SENIAM club (>100 members)
               together with a questionnaire to obtain their comments. Based on
               this evaluation the final recommendations of SENIAM were made
               and published (SENIAM 8: European recommendations for surface
               electromyography, 1999), both as a booklet and as a CD-ROM. In
               this way a common body of knowledge has been created on SEMG

              motor areas of the brain, and also a distinctive conscious
              experience that ``I'' am the author of the action. This paper
              investigates some possible ways in which these neural and
              phenomenal events may be related. Recent models of motor
              prediction are relevant to the conscious experience of action as
              well as to its neural control. Such models depend critically on
              matching the actual consequences of a movement against its
              internally predicted effects. However, it remains unclear whether
              our conscious experience of action depends on a precise matching
              process, or a retrospective inference that ``I'' must have been
              responsible for a particular event. We report an experiment in
              which normal subjects judged the perceived time of either
              intentional actions, involuntary movements, or subsequent effects
              (auditory tones) of these. We found that the subject's intention
              to produce the auditory tone produced an intentional binding
              between the perceived times of the subject's action and the tone.
              However, if the intention was interrupted by an imposed
              involuntary movement, followed by the identical tone, no such
              binding occurred. The phenomenology of intentional action
              requires an appropriate predictive link between intentions and

              is based on the extended International 10-20 system which
              contains 74 electrodes, and extends this system up to 345
              electrode locations. RESULTS: The positioning and nomenclature of
              the electrode system is described, and a subset of locations is
              proposed as especially useful for modern EEG/ERP systems, often
              having 128 channels available. CONCLUSION: Similar to the
              extension of the 10-20 system to the 10-10 system (``10\%
              system''), proposed in 1985, the goal of this new extension to a

              spatialized experience. A review of philosophical and other
              approaches has convinced us that the brain must come equipped to
              impose a three-dimensional Euclidean framework on experience --
              our analysis suggests that object re-identification may require
              such a framework. We identify this absolute, nonegocentric,
              spatial framework with a specific neural system centered in the
              hippocampus. A consideration of the kinds of behaviours in which
              such a spatial mapping system would be important is followed by
              an analysis of the anatomy and physiology of this system, with
              special emphasis on the place-coded neurons recorded in the
              hippocampus of freely moving rats. A tentative physiological
              model for the hippocampal cognitive map is proposed. A review of
              lesion studies, in tasks as diverse as discrimination learning,
              avoidance, and extinction, shows that the cognitive map notion
              can adequately explain much of the data. The model is extended to

              seek and consume more food under uncertainty in the wild. Our
              theoretical approach is in agreement with neuroscientific data
              relating to the role of dopamine, a neurotransmitter strongly
              involved in incentive motivation, and its plausibility has
              received some explanatory and predictive value with respect to
              Pavlovian phenomena. Overall, we argue that the occasional and
              unavoidable absence of food rewards has motivational effects
              (called incentive hope) that facilitate foraging effort. It is
              shown that this hypothesis is computationally tenable, leading
              foragers in an unpredictable environment to consume more food
              items and to have higher long-term energy storage than foragers
              in a predictable environment.",

              normally attributed to forward action models, such that when
              action prediction is consistent with changes in our environment,
              our experience of these effects is altered. Although much
              progress has been made in recent years in understanding sensory

              literature is decidedly mixed. This experiment tests the
              contributions of 4 components to metric survey knowledge: visual,
              vestibular, and podokinetic information and cognitive decision
              making. In the learning phase, 6 groups of participants learned
              the locations of 8 objects in a virtual hedge maze by (a)
              walking, (b) being pushed in a wheelchair, or (c) watching a
              video, crossed with (1) making decisions about their path or (2)
              being guided through the maze. In the test phase, survey
              knowledge was assessed by having participants walk a novel

              sensory, motor, and visual information and is thought to have an
              important role in processing spatial information and guiding
              behavior through complex environments. Anatomical and theoretical
              work has argued that the retrosplenial cortex participates in
              spatial behavior in concert with input from the parietal cortex.
              Although the nature of these interactions is unknown, a central
              position is that the functional connectivity is hierarchical with
              egocentric spatial information processed in the parietal cortex
              and higher-level allocentric mappings generated in the
              retrosplenial cortex. Here, we review the evidence supporting
              this proposal. We begin by summarizing the key anatomical
              features of the retrosplenial-parietal network, and then review
              studies investigating the neural correlates of these regions
              during spatial behavior. Our summary of this literature suggests
              that the retrosplenial-parietal circuitry does not represent a
              strict hierarchical parcellation of function between the two
              regions but instead a heterogeneous mixture of
              egocentric-allocentric coding and integration across frames of
              reference. We also suggest that this circuitry should be
              represented as a gradient of egocentric-to-allocentric
              information processing from parietal to retrosplenial cortices,
              with more specialized encoding of global allocentric frameworks
              within the retrosplenial cortex and more specialized egocentric
              and local allocentric representations in parietal cortex. We

              of mirror neurons in the motor cortex of the nonhuman primate.
              These neurons fire to both execution and observation of specific
              types of actions. Researchers use this evidence to fuel
              investigations of a human mirror system, suggesting a common
              neural code for perceptual and motor processes. Among the methods
              used for inferring mirror system activity in humans are changes
              in a particular frequency band in the electroencephalogram (EEG)
              called the mu rhythm. Mu frequency appears to decrease in
              amplitude (reflecting cortical activity) during both action
              execution and action observation. The current meta-analysis
              reviewed 85 studies (1,707 participants) of mu that infer human
              mirror system activity. Results demonstrated significant effect
              sizes for mu during execution (Cohen's d = 0.46, N = 701) as well

              valid means for the study of human neural mirroring. Suggestions

              alternative model using execution error alone was sufficient to
              describe the observed errors. A model incorporating both encoding
              and execution errors best described the triangle completion

              integration than do encoding errors, challenging the assumption
              that errors reflect encoding alone. Errors in triangle completion
              might not arise from failing to know where you are, but from an
              inability to get back home. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020

              actions and their outcomes. Previous research claimed that SoA is
              reflected in ``intentional binding'' effects, that is, the
              subjective compression of time between a voluntary action and an
              intended outcome. Conventional paradigms, however, typically lack
              an isolated manipulation of different degrees of agency (or
              intentionality), as the presence or absence of actions (along
              with subsequent perceptual changes) represents a potential
              confound variable. Using a newly developed paradigm, we were able
              to replicate typical ``intentional binding'' results in an
              initial experiment in which such a confound was deliberately
              included. We then eliminated this confound in a follow-up
              experiment by keeping the presence of actions and perceptual
              changes constant between conditions with and without agency while
              only manipulating subjective SoA. Here, explicit ratings showed
              that participants indeed felt responsible for effects in the
              Agency condition but not in the Baseline condition (demonstrating
              the successful manipulation of SoA), while we no longer found any
              differences in ``intentional binding'' effects between
              conditions. This indicates that previously reported relations
              between intentional binding and SoA could be merely based on
              procedural confounds. In particular, temporal compression effects

              contributor to metric survey knowledge (Chrastil \& Warren,
              2013). In this study, we test the contributions of 3 components
              to topological graph and route knowledge: visual information,
              idiothetic information, and cognitive decision making. Four
              groups of participants learned the locations of 8 objects in a
              virtual hedge maze by (a) walking or (b) watching a video,
              crossed with (1) either making decisions about their path or (2)
              being guided through the maze. Route and graph knowledge were

              virtual environment; Weisberg, Schinazi, Newcombe, Shipley, \&
              Epstein, 2014), we divided people into 3 groups based on their
              within-route and between-route pointing accuracy: integrators,
              non-integrators, and imprecise navigators. In Study 1, we found
              that imprecise navigators have lower spatial and verbal working
              memory, which may limit their ability to build accurate
              within-route representations. We also found that integrators

              version of the rodent T-maze (Marchette, Bakker, \& Shelton,

              did not have an overall preference for a place-based strategy,
              integrators who did choose a place-based strategy found more
              goals. The opposite was true for imprecise navigators. In Study

              the 'blindsight' that can follow damage to primary visual cortex,
              in the occipital lobe. We suggest that new insights into the
              neural basis of visual awareness may be gleaned from a different
              neuropsychological phenomenon, namely visual 'neglect' after
              injury to regions in the parietal lobe. Neglect provides several
              revealing contrasts with occipital blindsight. Here we summarise
              four key findings. First, unlike the deficits caused by damage to
              primary visual cortex, the loss of awareness in parietal neglect
              is characteristically not strictly retinotopic. Second, visual
              segmentation processes are preserved in neglect, and can
              influence what will reach the patient's awareness. Third,
              extensive unconscious processing takes place for those stimuli on
              the neglected side which escape awareness, including some degree
              of object identification. Finally, parietal damage affects
              initial stages of motor planning as well as perception. These
              findings are consistent with recent data on single-cell activity

              the properties of the object. Vision frequently dominates the
              integrated visual-haptic percept, for example when judging size,
              shape or position, but in some circumstances the percept is
              clearly affected by haptics. Here we propose that a general
              principle, which minimizes variance in the final estimate,
              determines the degree to which vision or haptics dominates. This
              principle is realized by using maximum-likelihood estimation to
              combine the inputs. To investigate cue combination

              visual and haptic estimation of height. We then used these

              model behaved very similarly to humans in a visual-haptic task.
              Thus, the nervous system seems to combine visual and haptic
              information in a fashion that is similar to a maximum-likelihood
              integrator. Visual dominance occurs when the variance associated

              The ventral, object-processing visual pathway carries precise

              warping the data to the dynamics of coordinating oscillations,

              enables the study of neural patterns as they unfold in the brain,

               There are two views on the relationship between cognition and
               the brain that are largely implicit in the literature. The
               Sherringtonian view seeks to explain cognition as the result of

               between them that are implemented by specific neurons and their
               connections in circuits in the brain. The contrasting

               spaces that are implemented by neural populations. Thus, the

              new experimental techniques and expand our capacity to manipulate
              the phenomenon of interest. Indeed, it is only when couched in
              terms of a theory that empirical discoveries can ultimately
              deliver a satisfying understanding of a phenomenon. However, in
              the case of consciousness, it is unclear how current theories
              relate to each other, or whether they can be empirically
              distinguished. To clarify this complicated landscape, we review
              four prominent theoretical approaches to consciousness:
              higher-order theories, global workspace theories, re-entry and
              predictive processing theories and integrated information theory.
              We describe the key characteristics of each approach by
              identifying which aspects of consciousness they propose to
              explain, what their neurobiological commitments are and what
              empirical data are adduced in their support. We consider how some
              prominent empirical debates might distinguish among these
              theories, and we outline three ways in which theories need to be
              developed to deliver a mature regimen of theory-testing in the
              neuroscience of consciousness. There are good reasons to think
              that the iterative development, testing and comparison of

              adaptation, yet it remains unclear whether it is specifically

              between the predicted and actual visual consequences of the
              movement). One reason for this is that PEs tend to be associated
              with task errors, as well as changes in motor output and visual
              input, making them difficult to isolate. Here this issue is
              addressed using electroencephalography. A strategy (STR)
              condition, in which participants were instructed on how to
              counter a 45° visuomotor rotation, was compared to a condition in
              which participants had adapted to the rotation (POST). Both
              conditions were matched for task errors and movement kinematics,
              with the only difference being the presence of PEs in STR.
              Results revealed strong parietal modulations in current source

              life that heavily depends on visual and vestibular information.
              To perceive the orientation of oneself with respect to the
              external environment would seem to first require that one has a
              clear sense of one's own body ('sense of body ownership').
              However, the experimental evidence for this is sparse. Therefore,
              the aim of the present study was to investigate how the sense of
              body ownership affects perceived self-orientation. We combined a
              self-orientation illusion - where the visual scene, i.e., a fully
              furnished room, was rotated slowly around the roll axis - with a
              full-body ownership illusion paradigm - where the ownership of a
              stranger's body seen from the first-person perspective in the
              center of the scene was manipulated by synchronous (illusion) or
              asynchronous (control) visual-tactile stimulation. Participants
              were asked to judge the appearance of shaded disk stimuli (a
              shape-from-shading test), which are perceived as
              three-dimensional (3D) spheres; this perception depends on
              perceived self-orientation. Illusory body ownership influenced
              self-orientation as reported subjectively in questionnaires and
              as evident from the objective shape-from-shading test data. Thus,
              body ownership determines self-orientation perception, presumably

              feedback during fast shooting movements under visuomotor
              rotation. Participants were instructed to strategically correct
              for performance errors by shooting to a neighboring target in one

              target, the neighboring target, both targets, or none of the
              targets disappeared. Participants in all conditions experienced a
              drift away from the main target following the strategy. In
              conditions where the main target was shown, participants often
              tried to minimize performance errors caused by the drift by
              generating corrective movements. However, despite differences in
              performance during adaptation between conditions, memory decay in
              a delayed washout block was indistinguishable between conditions.
              Our results thus suggest that, in visuomotor adaptation, sensory

               incorporating both bottom-up and top-down aspects of cross-modal
               attention in an EEG study. The same trimodal stimuli were
               presented in two distinct attentional conditions, focused on

              relevant to the task at hand: this is especially the case in
              complex, naturalistic scenes. This paper introduces a formal
              model of selective attention based on active inference and
              contextual epistemic foraging. We consider a visual search task
              with a special emphasis on goal-directed and task-relevant

              fidelity (precision) of the mapping between observations and
              hidden states in a state-dependent or context-sensitive manner.
              This ensures task-irrelevant observations have little expected
              information gain, and so the agent - driven to reduce expected
              surprise (i.e., uncertainty) - does not actively seek them out.
              Instead, it selectively samples task-relevant observations, which
              inform (task-relevant) hidden states. We further show, through
              simulations, that the atypical exploratory behaviours in

  abstract = "The Rubber Hand Illusion (RHI) opened the investigation of the
              sense of body ownership in healthy people. By putting in slight
              contrast vision touch and proprioception, healthy people embody a
              fake hand in one's body representation. The easiness of the
              procedure, typically measured with a set of questions that
              capture the subjective experience, favoured its blooming.
              However, validation studies of embodiment questionnaires are
              lacking, and the individual differences that contribute to the
              embodiment received little attention. In our study, 298
              participants underwent an RHI procedure following both
              synchronous and asynchronous (control) visuo-tactile
              stimulations. The study had multiple aims: (a) to explore the
              psychometric structure of a 27-items questionnaire largely used
              in the literature; (b) to build a psychometrically efficient
              scale to measure embodiment-related phenomena; (c) to explore
              whether and how individual differences (empathy, self-esteem and
              mindfulness) are associated with the experience of illusion. We
              found a relatively simple structure consisting of three
              components: embodiment of the rubber hand, disembodiment of the
              biological hand, physical sensations experienced during the
              procedure. The scales designed were psychometrically reliable and
              theoretically meaningful, encompassing 18 of the original items.
              Finally, by adopting a network analysis approach, we found that
              the embodiment is directly related to empathy and self-esteem,
              while disembodiment and physical sensation are unrelated to
              individual personality traits. The study provides substantial
              evidence to use the embodiment scale as a standard questionnaire
              for future RHI studies. Additionally, the correlations with
              personality traits suggest that the embodiment induced by the RHI
              deeply integrates with the complexity of the individuals and
              their differences.",

              stringent communication and computational needs, the user
              experience is influenced by delayed haptic feedback. While
              delayed feedback is well understood in the visual and auditory
              modalities, little research has systematically examined the
              neural correlates associated with delayed haptic feedback. In
              this paper, we used electroencephalography (EEG) to study sensory
              and cognitive neural correlates caused by haptic delay during
              passive and active tasks performed using a haptic device and a
              computer screen. Results revealed that theta power oscillation
              was significantly higher at the midfrontal cortex under the
              presence of haptic delay. Sensory correlates represented by beta
              rebound were found to be similar in the passive task and
              different in the active task under the delayed and synchronous
              conditions. Additionally, the event related potential (ERP) P200
              component is modulated under the haptic delay condition during
              the passive task. The P200 amplitude significantly reduced in the
              last 20\% of trials during the passive task and in the absence of
              haptic delay. Results suggest that haptic delay could be
              associated with increased cognitive control processes including
              multi-sensory divided attention followed by conflict detection
              and resolution with an earlier detection during the active task.
              Additionally, haptic delay tends to generate greater perceptual

               means to control such assistive robotic manipulators. However,
               BCI performance may vary due to the non-stationary nature of the

               safely for controlling tasks where errors may be detrimental to
               the user. Avoiding obstacles is one such task. As there exist
               many techniques to avoid obstacles in robotics, we propose to
               give the control to the robot to avoid obstacles and to leave to
               the user the choice of the robot behavior to do so a matter of
               personal preference as some users may be more daring while
               others more careful. We enable the users to train the robot
               controller to adapt its way to approach obstacles relying on BCI
               that detects error-related potentials (ErrP), indicative of the
               user's error expectation of the robot's current strategy to meet
               their preferences. Gaussian process-based inverse reinforcement
               learning, in combination with the ErrP-BCI, infers the user's
               preference and updates the obstacle avoidance controller so as
               to generate personalized robot trajectories. We validate the
               approach in experiments with thirteen able-bodied subjects using
               a robotic arm that picks up, places and avoids real-life
               objects. Results show that the algorithm can learn user's
               preference and adapt the robot behavior rapidly using less than

               table requires demonstrations from expert operators, but what if

               robot autonomy and a brain-computer interfacing that decodes
               whether the generated trajectories meet the user's criteria, and

               human-like intellectual capacities. It was previously proposed
               that the brain may operate on the principle of predictive
               coding. However, it is still not well understood how a
               predictive system could be implemented in the brain. Here we
               demonstrate that the ability of a single neuron to predict its
               future activity may provide an effective learning mechanism.
               Interestingly, this predictive learning rule can be derived from
               a metabolic principle, whereby neurons need to minimize their
               own synaptic activity (cost) while maximizing their impact on
               local blood supply by recruiting other neurons. We show how this
               mathematically derived learning rule can provide a theoretical
               connection between diverse types of brain-inspired algorithm,
               thus offering a step towards the development of a general theory
               of neuronal learning. We tested this predictive learning rule in
               neural network simulations and in data recorded from awake

               activity provides `training data' for neurons to learn to
               predict cortical dynamics. Thus, the ability of a single neuron
               to minimize surprise---that is, the difference between actual
               and expected activity---could be an important missing element to
               understand computation in the brain. In artificial neural
               networks, a typical neuron generally performs a simple summation
               of inputs. Using computational and electrophysiological data,
               the authors show that a single neuron predicts its future
               activity. Neurons that predict their own future responses are a

               importance of the sense of agency in joint control between
               humans and automated systems. In this Review, we first provide
               an overview of how the sense of agency influences human
               perception and how the perceptual effects of the sense of agency
               are used to measure this subjective feeling. Second, we review
               how the sense of agency modulates behaviour, including action
               selection, goal-directed actions, and social cognition. Third,
               we introduce theoretical and neural accounts of how the sense of
               agency arises. Finally, we explain how the sense of agency
               applies to human--machine interactions, an area that is rapidly
               developing and increasingly linked to daily life. The sense of
               agency refers to the feeling of controlling one's own actions

              lack a robust classification of motor-related patterns. Here, we
              introduce new features of motor-related brain activity and

              considering event-related desynchronization (ERD) of $\mu$-rhythm

              presumed to reflect the final stages of planning and preparation
              for movement. Here we present a different interpretation of the
              premovement buildup. We used a leaky stochastic accumulator to
              model the neural decision of ``when'' to move in a task where
              there is no specific temporal cue, but only a general imperative
              to produce a movement after an unspecified delay on the order of
              several seconds. According to our model, when the imperative to
              produce a movement is weak, the precise moment at which the
              decision threshold is crossed leading to movement is largely
              determined by spontaneous subthreshold fluctuations in neuronal
              activity. Time locking to movement onset ensures that these
              fluctuations appear in the average as a gradual
              exponential-looking increase in neuronal activity. Our model
              accounts for the behavioral and electroencephalography data

              attributes. Exp. 2 with an additional 16 participants
              extinguished the ownership illusion by using visuomotor
              asynchrony, with all else equal. The size-estimation and implicit
              association test differences between C and A were also

              and pathological cognitive outcomes has proved challenging. Here

              system generated the necessary input itself, based on real-time
              analysis of brain activity. Specific brain responses were evoked
              by violating the operators' expectations to varying degrees. The
              evoked brain activity demonstrated detectable differences
              reflecting congruency with or deviations from the operators'

              build a user model of those expectations, thus representing the

              this model, which was continuously updated, the computer

              unclear, but a likely locus is lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC).
              Neurons in LPFC play a prominent role in working memory and have
              been shown to encode behavioral strategies. To examine the role
              of LPFC in overcoming working-memory limitations, we recorded the
              activity of LPFC neurons in animals trained to perform a serial
              self-ordered search task. This task measured the ability to
              prospectively plan the selection of unchosen spatial search
              targets while retrospectively tracking which targets were
              previously visited. We found that individual LPFC neurons encoded
              the spatial location of the current search target but also
              encoded the spatial location of targets up to several steps away
              in the search sequence. Neurons were more likely to encode
              prospective than retrospective targets. When subjects used a
              behavioral strategy of stereotyped target selection, mitigating
              the working-memory requirements of the task, not only did the
              number of selection errors decrease but there was a significant
              reduction in the strength of spatial encoding in LFPC. These
              results show that LPFC neurons have spatiotemporal mnemonic
              fields, in that their firing rates are modulated both by the
              spatial location of future selection behaviors and the temporal
              organization of that behavior. Furthermore, the strength of this
              tuning can be dynamically modulated by the demands of the task.",

  abstract = "Enjoying music reliably ranks among life's greatest pleasures.
              Like many hedonic experiences, it engages several reward-related
              brain areas, with activity in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) most
              consistently reflecting the listener's subjective response.
              Converging evidence suggests that this activity arises from
              musical ``reward prediction errors'' (RPEs) that signal the
              difference between expected and perceived musical events, but
              this hypothesis has not been directly tested. In the present fMRI
              experiment, we assessed whether music could elicit formally
              modeled RPEs in the NAc by applying a well-established
              decision-making protocol designed and validated for studying
              RPEs. In the scanner, participants chose between arbitrary cues
              that probabilistically led to dissonant or consonant music, and
              learned to make choices associated with the consonance, which
              they preferred. We modeled regressors of trial-by-trial RPEs,
              finding that NAc activity tracked musically elicited RPEs, to an
              extent that explained variance in the individual learning rates.
              These results demonstrate that music can act as a reward, driving
              learning and eliciting RPEs in the NAc, a hub of reward- and

              location. How does the brain decide when to leave, and how does
              it determine the speed of the ensuing movement? Here, we
              considered the possibility that both the decision-making and the
              motor control problems aimed to maximize a single normative
              utility: the sum of all rewards acquired minus all efforts
              expended divided by total time. This optimization could be
              achieved if the brain compared a local measure of utility with
              its history. To test the theory, we examined behavior of people
              as they gazed at images: they chose how long to look at the image
              (harvesting information) and then moved their eyes to another
              image, controlling saccade speed. We varied reward via image
              content and effort via image eccentricity, and then, we measured
              how these changes affected decision making (gaze duration) and
              motor control (saccade speed). After a history of low rewards,
              people increased gaze duration and decreased saccade speed. In
              anticipation of future effort, they lowered saccade speed and
              increased gaze duration. After a history of high effort, they
              elevated their saccade speed and increased gaze duration.
              Therefore, the theory presented a principled way with which the
              brain may control two aspects of behavior: movement speed and
              harvest duration. Our experiments confirmed many (but not all) of

              difficult to identify persons ``at high risk'' of AD in the

              navigation big data (n = 27,108) from the Sea Hero Quest (SHQ)
              game to overcome these challenges by investigating whether big

              a fundamental challenge for the brain. Neural oscillations,
              especially $\gamma$-oscillations, have been proposed as a
              potential mechanism to solve this problem. However, since
              $\gamma$-oscillations usually reflect local neural activity, how
              to implement feature binding involving a large-scale brain
              network remains largely unknown. Here, combining
              electroencephalogram (EEG) and transcranial alternating current
              stimulation (tACS), we employed a bistable color-motion binding
              stimulus to probe the role of neural oscillations in feature
              binding. Subjects' perception of the stimulus switched between
              its physical binding and its illusory (active) binding. The
              active binding has been shown to involve a large-scale network
              consisting of spatially distant brain areas.
              $\alpha$-Oscillations presumably reflect the dynamics of such
              large-scale networks, especially due to volume conduction effects
              in EEG. We found that, relative to the physical binding, the
              $\alpha$-power decreased during the active binding. Additionally,
              individual $\alpha$-power was negatively correlated with the time
              proportion of the active binding. Subjects' perceptual switch
              rate between the 2 bindings was positively correlated with their
              individual $\alpha$-frequency. Furthermore, applying tACS at
              individual $\alpha$-frequency decreased the time proportion of
              the active binding. Moreover, delivering tACS at different
              temporal frequencies in the $\alpha$-band changed subjects'
              perceptual switch rate through affecting the active binding
              process. Our findings provide converging evidence for the causal
              role of $\alpha$-oscillations in feature binding, especially in

              participants performed twelve work-related tasks with both types
              of exoskeletons and without (NoExo). The CrayX hindered work
              performance up to 22\% in multiple tasks, compared to the Paexo
              Back and NoExo, while work performance between NoExo and the

              investigated by evaluating the active CrayX and passive Paexo

               approach can be very useful, it offers little help in tackling
               questions of causality in the kind of data that are increasingly
               common in HCI ? capturing user behavior ?in the wild.? To
               analyze such data, model-based regressions such as cross-lagged
               panel models or vector autoregressions can be used, but these
               require parametric assumptions about the structural form of
               effects among the variables. To overcome some of the limitations
               associated with experiments and model-based regressions, we
               adopt and extend ?empirical dynamic modelling? methods from
               ecology that lend themselves to conceptualizing multiple users?
               behavior as complex nonlinear dynamical systems. Extending a
               method known as ?convergent cross mapping? or CCM, we show how
               to make causal inferences that do not rely on experimental
               manipulations or model-based regressions and, by virtue of being

              of studies (n = 50) regarding gaze behavior and performance when
              piloting an aircraft. Background: Optimal gaze behavior can lead
              to improved flying performance under both normal and stressful
              conditions. Method: A computerized as well as a manual search of
              the literature was conducted. Articles were grouped according to
              prevalent themes, such as basic cockpit visual scanning, visual
              scanning in the automated cockpit, effects of new technology on
              visual scanning, nonnormal flight circumstances, differences
              between experts and novices, and mathematical models of visual
              scanning. A summary and key findings for each theme were
              reported. Results: The review revealed specific gaze behaviors
              that might be important when performing various flight tasks and
              when monitoring automated processes, and that can differentiate
              between expert and novice pilots. However, several concerns arose
              from the review. Among these concerns are the unexamined role of
              peripheral vision, the scarcity of studies on in-flight
              emergencies, and the lack of interventional studies. Conclusion:
              Specific gaze patterns appear to be related to improved flight
              performance. Future studies should address the methodological
              concerns mentioned to better clarify the relationship between

  abstract  = "Abstract Spatial cognitive processes can be based on distinct
               reference frames centered on the body (egocentric reference
               frame) or centered on aspects of the surrounding environment
               independent of the position and orientation of the cognizing
               subject (allocentric reference frame). Updating of spatial
               information based on an egocentric reference frame is often
               believed to be highly automatic while the computation of spatial
               information based on an allocentric reference frame is assumed
               to be effortful and dependent on prior egocentric space
               processing. In this position paper I will review theoretical and
               empirical work that challenges the view of such a hierarchical
               organization of spatial reference frames and propose an embodied
               view of spatial reference frame computation. This perspective is
               based on three interdependent aspects of spatial reference
               frames. First, based on the existence of neural structures that
               allow for an automatic computation of both, egocentric and
               allocentric spatial representations, a functional equivalence of
               distinct reference frames is proposed. Second, based on the
               assumption of efficient computation and parallel accessibility
               of distinct reference frames individual proclivities are
               proposed to develop based on environmental and socio-cultural
               influences. Finally, it is proposed that ontogenetic differences
               are manifest in anatomical changes associated with the dominant
               use of different reference frames. These changes influence the
               microgenesis of spatial knowledge and influence behavior in
               other spatial cognitive tasks. In conclusion, an embodied
               framework of spatial reference frames strongly suggests
               consideration of individual reference frame proclivities to gain
               further insights into the complex architecture of human spatial
               cognition. More importantly, neuroscientific approaches
               describing cortical networks and associated brain dynamics have
               to allow participants to actively move and behave in their
               environment to allow for investigating the cognitive processes

               incidental responses when errors occur (e.g. they may swear) and
               that they may pause to analyse their errors. In all these cases

  abstract = "Two experiments examined how locations in environmental spaces,
              which cannot be overseen from one location, are represented in
              memory: by global reference frames, multiple local reference
              frames, or orientation-free representations. After learning an
              immersive virtual environment by repeatedly walking a closed
              multisegment route, participants pointed to seven previously
              learned targets from different locations. Contrary to many
              conceptions of survey knowledge, local reference frames played an
              important role: Participants performed better when their body or
              pointing targets were aligned with the local reference frame
              (corridor). Moreover, most participants turned their head to
              align it with local reference frames. However, indications for
              global reference frames were also found: Participants performed
              better when their body or current corridor was
              parallel/orthogonal to a global reference frame instead of
              oblique. Participants showing this pattern performed
              comparatively better. We conclude that survey tasks can be solved
              based on interconnected local reference frames. Participants who
              pointed more accurately or quickly additionally used global
              reference frames.",

  abstract  = "By grounding the self in the body, experimental psychology has
               taken the body as the starting point for a science of the self.
               One fundamental dimension of the bodily self is the sense of
               body ownership that refers to the special perceptual status of
               one's own body, the feeling that ?my body? belongs to me. The
               primary aim of this review article is to highlight recent
               advances in the study of body ownership and our understanding of
               the underlying neurocognitive processes in three ways. I first
               consider how the sense of body ownership has been investigated
               and elucidated in the context of multisensory integration.
               Beyond exteroception, recent studies have considered how this
               exteroceptively driven sense of body ownership can be linked to
               the other side of embodiment, that of the unobservable, yet
               felt, interoceptive body, suggesting that these two sides of
               embodiment interact to provide a unifying bodily self. Lastly,
               the multisensorial understanding of the self has been shown to
               have implications for our understanding of social relationships,
               especially in the context of self?other boundaries. Taken
               together, these three research strands motivate a unified model

  abstract = "We offer a formal treatment of choice behavior based on the
              premise that agents minimize the expected free energy of future
              outcomes. Crucially, the negative free energy or quality of a
              policy can be decomposed into extrinsic and epistemic (or
              intrinsic) value. Minimizing expected free energy is therefore
              equivalent to maximizing extrinsic value or expected utility
              (defined in terms of prior preferences or goals), while
              maximizing information gain or intrinsic value (or reducing
              uncertainty about the causes of valuable outcomes). The resulting
              scheme resolves the exploration-exploitation dilemma: Epistemic
              value is maximized until there is no further information gain,
              after which exploitation is assured through maximization of
              extrinsic value. This is formally consistent with the Infomax
              principle, generalizing formulations of active vision based upon
              salience (Bayesian surprise) and optimal decisions based on
              expected utility and risk-sensitive (Kullback-Leibler) control.
              Furthermore, as with previous active inference formulations of
              discrete (Markovian) problems, ad hoc softmax parameters become
              the expected (Bayes-optimal) precision of beliefs about, or

               different application areas of the method of eye tracking in the
               field of aviation.Background: Psychophysiological measures such
               as eye tracking in pilots are useful for detecting fatigue or
               high-workload conditions, for investigating motion sickness and
               hypoxia, or for assessing display improvements and
               expertise.Method: We review the uses of eye tracking on pilots
               and include eye-tracking studies published in aviation journals,
               with both a historical and contemporary view. We include 79
               papers and assign the results to the following three categories:
               Human performance, aircraft design, health and physiological
               factors affecting performance. We then summarize the different
               uses of eye tracking in each category and highlight metrics
               which turned out to be useful in each area. Our review is
               complementary to that of Ziv (2016).Results: On the basis of
               these analyses, we propose useful application areas for the
               measurement of eye tracking. Eye tracking has the potential to
               be effective in terms of preventing errors or injuries by
               detecting, for example, fatigue or performance decrements.

  abstract  = "OBJECTIVE: Despite the high number of degrees of freedom of the
               human hand, most actions of daily life can be executed
               incorporating only palmar, pincer and lateral grasp. In this
               study we attempt to discriminate these three different executed
               reach-and-grasp actions utilizing their EEG neural correlates.
               APPROACH: In a cue-guided experiment, 15 healthy individuals
               were asked to perform these actions using daily life objects. We
               recorded 72 trials for each reach-and-grasp condition and from a
               no-movement condition. MAIN RESULTS: Using low-frequency time
               domain features from 0.3 to 3 Hz, we achieved binary
               classification accuracies of 72.4\%, STD $\pm$ 5.8\% between
               grasp types, for grasps versus no-movement condition peak
               performances of 93.5\%, STD $\pm$ 4.6\% could be reached. In an
               offline multiclass classification scenario which incorporated
               not only all reach-and-grasp actions but also the no-movement
               condition, the highest performance could be reached using a
               window of 1000 ms for feature extraction. Classification
               performance peaked at 65.9\%, STD $\pm$ 8.1\%. Underlying neural
               correlates of the reach-and-grasp actions, investigated over the
               primary motor cortex, showed significant differences starting
               from approximately 800 ms to 1200 ms after the movement onset
               which is also the same time frame where classification
               performance reached its maximum. SIGNIFICANCE: We could show
               that it is possible to discriminate three executed
               reach-and-grasp actions prominent in people's everyday use from
               non-invasive EEG. Underlying neural correlates showed
               significant differences between all tested conditions. These
               findings will eventually contribute to our attempt of
               controlling a neuroprosthesis in a natural and intuitive way,

  author   = "Krol, Laurens R and Haselager, Pim and Zander, Thorsten O",
  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: The interpretation of neurophysiological measurements
              has a decades-long history, culminating in current real-time
              brain-computer interfacing (BCI) applications for both patient
              and healthy populations. Over the course of this history, one
              focus has been on the investigation of cortical responses to
              specific stimuli. Such responses can be informative with respect
              to the human user's mental state at the time of presentation. An
              ability to decode neurophysiological responses to stimuli in real
              time becomes particularly powerful when combined with a
              simultaneous ability to autonomously produce such stimuli. This
              allows a computer to gather stimulus-response samples and
              iteratively produce new stimuli based on the information gathered
              from previous samples, thus acquiring more, and more specific,
              information. This information can even be obtained without the
              explicit, voluntary involvement of the user. APPROACH: We define
              cognitive and affective probing, referring to an application of
              active learning where repeated sampling is done by eliciting
              implicit brain responses. In this tutorial, we provide a
              definition of this method that unifies different past and current
              implementations based on common aspects. We then discuss a number
              of aspects that differentiate various possible implementations of
              cognitive probing. MAIN RESULTS: We argue that a key element is
              the user model, which serves as both information storage and
              basis for subsequent probes. Cognitive probing can be used to
              continuously and autonomously update this model, refining the
              probes, and obtaining increasingly detailed or accurate
              information from the resulting brain activity. In contrast to a
              number of potential advantages of the method, cognitive probing
              may also pose a threat to informed consent, our privacy of
              thought, and our ability to assign responsibility to actions
              mediated by the system. SIGNIFICANCE: This tutorial provides
              guidelines to both implement, and critically discuss potential
              ethical implications of, novel cognitive probing applications and

  abstract = "Objective.When humans perceive an erroneous action, an EEG
              error-related potential (ErrP) is elicited as a neural response.
              ErrPs have been largely investigated in discrete feedback
              protocols, where actions are executed at discrete steps, to
              enable seamless brain-computer interaction. However, there are
              only a few studies that investigate ErrPs in continuous feedback
              protocols. The objective of the present study is to better
              understand the differences between two types of ErrPs elicited
              during continuous feedback protocols, where errors may occur
              either at predicted or unpredicted states. We hypothesize that
              ErrPs of the unpredicted state is associated with longer latency
              as it requires higher cognitive workload to evaluate actions
              compared to the predicted states.Approach.Participants monitored
              the trajectory of an autonomous cursor that occasionally made
              erroneous actions on its way to the target in two conditions,
              namely, predicted or unpredicted states. After characterizing the
              ErrP waveform elicited by erroneous actions in the two
              conditions, we performed single-trial decoding of ErrPs in both
              synchronous (i.e. time-locked to the onset of the erroneous
              action) and asynchronous manner. Furthermore, we explored the
              possibility to transfer decoders built with data of one of the
              conditions to the other condition.Main results.As hypothesized,
              erroneous actions at unpredicted states gave rise to ErrPs with
              higher latency than erroneous actions at predicted states, a
              correlate of higher cognitive effort in the former condition.
              Moreover, ErrP decoders trained in a given condition successfully
              transferred to the other condition with a slight loss of
              classification performance. This was the case for synchronous as
              well as asynchronous ErrP decoding, showing the invariability of
              ErrPs across conditions.Significance.These results advance the
              characterization of ErrPs during continuous feedback protocols,
              enlarging the potential use of ErrPs during natural operation of
              brain-controlled devices as it is not necessary to have different
              decoders for each kind of erroneous conditions.",

              event-related potential (ERP) features across many different
              experimental parameters have the potential to improve the
              generalizability of ERP findings and may help to accelerate
              ERP-based biomarker discovery by identifying the exact
              experimental conditions for which ERPs differ most for a certain
              clinical population. Obtaining robust and reliable ERPs online is
              a prerequisite for ERP-based neuroadaptive research. One of the
              key steps involved is to correctly isolate electroencephalography
              artifacts in real time because they contribute a large amount of
              variance that, if not removed, will greatly distort the ERP
              obtained. Another key factor of concern is the computational cost
              of the online artifact handling method. This work aims to develop
              and validate a cost-efficient system to support ERP-based
              neuroadaptive research.Approach.We developed a simple online
              artifact handling method, single trial PCA-based artifact removal
              (SPA), based on variance distribution dichotomies to distinguish
              between artifacts and neural activity. We then applied this
              method in an ERP-based neuroadaptive paradigm in which Bayesian
              optimization was used to search individually optimal
              inter-stimulus-interval (ISI) that generates ERP with the highest
              signal-to-noise ratio.Main results.SPA was compared to other
              offline and online algorithms. The results showed that SPA
              exhibited good performance in both computational efficiency and
              preservation of ERP pattern. Based on SPA, the Bayesian

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Lower limb amputees suffer from a variety of
              functional deficits related to the absence of sensory
              communication between the central nervous system and the lost
              extremity. Indeed, they experience high risk of falls, asymmetric
              walking and balance, and low prosthesis embodiment, that
              significantly decrease their quality of life. Presently, there
              are no commercially available devices able to provide sensory
              feedback to leg amputees. Recently, some invasive solutions (i.e.
              requiring a surgery) have been proposed by different research
              groups, however a non-invasive effective alternative exploitable
              in everyday life is still missing. APPROACH: To address this need
              we developed and tested a lightweight, non-invasive, wearable
              technology (NeuroLegs) providing sensory (i.e. knee angle joint
              and tactile) feedback to the users through electro-cutaneous
              stimulation. A user-friendly GUI and mobile App have been
              developed to easily calibrate and control the system. Standard
              mechanical and electrical tests were performed to assess the
              safety and reliability of the technology. MAIN RESULTS: No
              mechanical failures, stable communication among system parts and
              a long-lasting battery (>23h) were demonstrated. The NeuroLegs
              system was then verified in terms of accuracy in measuring
              relevant gait parameters in healthy participants. A high temporal
              reliability was found when detecting stride features (important
              for the real-time configuration) with a correct match to the
              walking cadence, in all assessed walking conditions. The
              effectiveness of the NeuroLegs system at improving walking of
              three transfemoral amputees was then verified in movement
              laboratory tests. Increased temporal gait symmetry and augmented
              confidence were found. Stepping outside from the lab, Neurolegs
              was successfully exploited by a transfemoral amputee in CYBATHLON
              Global Edition 2020 in several challenging situations related to

              that the NeuroLegs system provides the user with useful sensory

              as it allows user assessment without breaking the immersive
              experience. In VR, designing immersion is one key challenge.
              Subjective questionnaires are the established metrics to assess
              the effectiveness of immersive VR simulations. However,
              administering such questionnaires requires breaking the immersive

              complimentary metric based on a event-related potentials. For the
              metric to be robust, the neural signal employed must be reliable.
              Hence, it is beneficial to target the neural signal's cortical
              origin directly, efficiently separating signal from noise. To
              test this new complementary metric, we designed a reach-to-tap

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: High-density electroencephelography (EEG) can provide
              an insight into human brain function during real-world activities
              with walking. Some recent studies have used EEG to characterize
              brain activity during walking, but the relative contributions of
              movement artifact and electrocortical activity have been
              difficult to quantify. We aimed to characterize movement artifact
              recorded by EEG electrodes at a range of walking speeds and to
              test the efficacy of artifact removal methods. We also quantified
              the similarity between movement artifact recorded by EEG
              electrodes and a head-mounted accelerometer. APPROACH: We used a
              novel experimental method to isolate and record movement artifact
              with EEG electrodes during walking. We blocked
              electrophysiological signals using a nonconductive layer
              (silicone swim cap) and simulated an electrically conductive
              scalp on top of the swim cap using a wig coated with conductive
              gel. We recorded motion artifact EEG data from nine young human
              subjects walking on a treadmill at speeds from 0.4 to 1.6 m
              s(-1). We then tested artifact removal methods including moving
              average and wavelet-based techniques. MAIN RESULTS: Movement
              artifact recorded with EEG electrodes varied considerably, across
              speed, subject, and electrode location. The movement artifact
              measured with EEG electrodes did not correlate well with head
              acceleration. All of the tested artifact removal methods
              attenuated low-frequency noise but did not completely remove
              movement artifact. The spectral power fluctuations in the
              movement artifact data resembled data from some previously
              published studies of EEG during walking. SIGNIFICANCE: Our
              results suggest that EEG data recorded during walking likely
              contains substantial movement artifact that: cannot be explained
              by head accelerations; varies across speed, subject, and channel;
              and cannot be removed using traditional signal processing

  author    = "Robinson, Neethu and Guan, Cuntai and Vinod, A P",
  abstract  = "OBJECTIVE: The various parameters that define a hand movement
               such as its trajectory, speed, etc, are encoded in distinct
               brain activities. Decoding this information from
               neurophysiological recordings is a less explored area of
               brain-computer interface (BCI) research. Applying non-invasive
               recordings such as electroencephalography (EEG) for decoding
               makes the problem more challenging, as the encoding is assumed
               to be deep within the brain and not easily accessible by scalp
               recordings. APPROACH: EEG based BCI systems can be developed to
               identify the neural features underlying movement parameters that
               can be further utilized to provide a detailed and well defined
               control command set to a BCI output device. A real-time
               continuous control is better suited for practical BCI systems,
               and can be achieved by continuous adaptive reconstruction of
               movement trajectory than discrete brain activity
               classifications. In this work, we adaptively
               reconstruct/estimate the parameters of two-dimensional hand
               movement trajectory, namely movement speed and position, from
               multi-channel EEG recordings. The data for analysis is collected
               by performing an experiment that involved center-out right-hand
               movement tasks in four different directions at two different
               speeds in random order. We estimate movement trajectory using a
               Kalman filter that models the relation between brain activity
               and recorded parameters based on a set of defined predictors. We
               propose a method to define these predictor variables that
               includes spatial, spectral and temporally localized neural
               information and to select optimally informative variables. MAIN
               RESULTS: The proposed method yielded correlation of (0.60 $\pm$
               0.07) between recorded and estimated data. Further,
               incorporating the proposed predictor subset selection, the
               correlation achieved is (0.57 $\pm$ 0.07, p < 0.004) with
               significant gain in stability of the system, as well as dramatic
               reduction in number of predictors (76\%) for the savings of
               computational time. SIGNIFICANCE: The proposed system provides a
               real time movement control system using EEG-BCI with control
               over movement speed and position. These results are higher and
               statistically significant compared to existing techniques in EEG
               based systems and thus promise the applicability of the proposed
               method for efficient estimation of movement parameters and for
               continuous motor control.",

  abstract  = "OBJECTIVE: Oscillations are an important aspect of brain
               activity, but they often have a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
               due to source-to-electrode mixing with competing brain activity
               and noise. Filtering can improve the SNR of narrowband signals,
               but it introduces ringing effects that may masquerade as genuine
               oscillations, leading to uncertainty as to the true oscillatory
               nature of the phenomena. Likewise, time-frequency analysis
               kernels have a temporal extent that blurs the time course of
               narrowband activity, introducing uncertainty as to timing and
               causal relations between events and/or frequency bands.
               APPROACH: Here, we propose a methodology that reveals narrowband
               activity within multichannel data such as
               electroencephalography, magnetoencephalography,
               electrocorticography or local field potential. The method
               exploits the between-channel correlation structure of the data
               to suppress competing sources by joint diagonalization of the
               covariance matrices of narrowband filtered and unfiltered data.
               MAIN RESULTS: Applied to synthetic and real data, the method
               effectively extracts narrowband components at unfavorable SNR.
               SIGNIFICANCE: Oscillatory components of brain activity,
               including weak sources that are hard or impossible to observe

  abstract  = "OBJECTIVE: In this study we aimed for the classification of
               operator workload as it is expected in many real-life workplace
               environments. We explored brain-signal based workload predictors
               that differ with respect to the level of label information
               required for training, including entirely unsupervised
               approaches. APPROACH: Subjects executed a task on a touch screen
               that required continuous effort of visual and motor processing
               with alternating difficulty. We first employed classical
               approaches for workload state classification that operate on the
               sensor space of EEG and compared those to the performance of
               three state-of-the-art spatial filtering methods: common spatial
               patterns (CSPs) analysis, which requires binary label
               information; source power co-modulation (SPoC) analysis, which
               uses the subjects' error rate as a target function; and
               canonical SPoC (cSPoC) analysis, which solely makes use of
               cross-frequency power correlations induced by different states
               of workload and thus represents an unsupervised approach.
               Finally, we investigated the effects of fusing brain signals and
               peripheral physiological measures (PPMs) and examined the added
               value for improving classification performance. MAIN RESULTS:
               Mean classification accuracies of 94\%, 92\% and 82\% were
               achieved with CSP, SPoC, cSPoC, respectively. These methods
               outperformed the approaches that did not use spatial filtering
               and they extracted physiologically plausible components. The
               performance of the unsupervised cSPoC is significantly increased
               by augmenting it with PPM features. SIGNIFICANCE: Our analyses
               ensured that the signal sources used for classification were of
               cortical origin and not contaminated with artifacts. Our
               findings show that workload states can be successfully
               differentiated from brain signals, even when less and less
               information from the experimental paradigm is used, thus paving

               of tactile stimuli in order to interact intelligently with the
               environment and with humans. Such assessments will depend on
               exquisite and robust mechanosensors, but sensors alone do not
               make judgments and choices. Rather, the central processing of
               mechanosensor inputs must be implemented with algorithms that
               produce `behavioral states' in the artificial agent that
               resemble or mimic perceptual judgments in biology. In this
               study, we consider the problem of perceptual judgment as applied
               to vibration intensity. By a combination of computational
               modeling and simulation followed by psychophysical testing of
               vibration intensity perception in rats, we show that a simple
               yet highly salient judgment---is the current stimulus strong or
               weak?---can be explained as the comparison of ongoing sensory
               input against a criterion constructed as the time-weighted
               average of the history of recent stimuli. Simulations and
               experiments explore how judgments are shaped by the distribution

               by the time constant of integration which dictates the dynamics
               of criterion updating. The findings of this study imply that
               judgments made by the real nervous system are not absolute

              percept (default or alternative) elicited by a bistable figure.
              The two distributed patterns included core nodes of the
              default-mode and frontoparietal networks (FPN), and they were
              most highly coupled to each other during the alternative percept,
              whereas they were less coupled during the default percept.
              Surprisingly, the regions associated with the nonengaged percept
              exhibited the highest connectivity to the LOC. Together, these
              findings reveal a dynamic organization between the default mode
              and the FPNs, and the incoming bottom-up visual stream during

              activation of brain resting-state networks (RSNs) is nontrivial
              as the signal of interest is of low amplitude and it is difficult
              to distinguish the underlying neural sources. Using the
              principles of electric field topographical analysis, it is
              possible to estimate the meta-stable states of the brain (i.e.,
              the resting-state topographies, so-called microstates). We
              estimated seven resting-state topographies explaining the EEG
              data set with k-means clustering (N = 164, 256 electrodes). Using
              a method specifically designed to localize the sources of
              broadband EEG scalp topographies by matching sensor and source
              space temporal patterns, we demonstrated that we can estimate the
              EEG RSNs reliably by measuring the reproducibility of our
              findings. After subtracting their mean from the seven EEG RSNs,
              we identified seven state-specific networks. The mean map

              be interpreted as a ``router,'' crosslinking multiple functional

              Picking up bananas evoked decreased theta activation on central

              Falling off the game board evoked decreased central theta
              activation and increased fronto-central beta activation. Reaching
              the goal evoked increased theta activation on parietal

  abstract = "Background: Physical inactivity has been identified as the fourth
              leading cause of death globally. It is now well established that
              a sedentary lifestyle is a unique risk factor for several
              diseases such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease,
              which account for about 30\% of global mortality. Diabetes is a
              major preventable cause of costly and debilitating renal failure,
              heart disease, lower limb amputation, and avoidable blindness. In
              recent years, the idea of using interactive computing systems
              that leverage gamification to promote physical activity has been
              widely researched. Prior studies have shown that exergames, that
              is those that encourage physical activity, can increase enjoyment
              and intrinsic motivation compared with conventional exercises; as
              such, they can be effective in promoting physical and mental
              health. There has been some research on immersive virtual reality
              (VR) exergames; however, to the best of our knowledge, it is
              limited and preliminary. This work aims at filling the gap and
              investigates the effect of display type (DT) and viewing
              perspective (VP) on players' exertion, engagement, and overall
              game experience in immersive VR exergames. Objective: This
              article aims at examining whether DT and VP can affect gameplay
              performance, players' exertion, game experience, cybersickness,
              and electroencephalography (EEG) engagement index when playing a
              gesture-based (i.e., body motion) exergame. Materials and
              Methods: Study 1 employed a one-way between-subjects design with
              24 participants equally distributed in two groups (immersive VR
              and 50-inch TV) to perform 12 pre-defined gestures. The main
              outcome measures were National Aeronautics and Space
              Administration-Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) workload for each group
              as well as 7 Likert scale and EEG engagement index for each
              gesture. Study 2 included 16 participants in playing a game with
              the gestures selected from study 1. All participants played 4
              versions based on combinations of DT (immersive VR and 50-inch
              TV) and VP (first-person and third-person) to assess exertion
              (\%HRmax, calories consumption, and Borg RPE 6-20), game
              experience, cybersickness, and EEG engagement index. Results:
              Study 1 results showed that DT had no effect on the ratings of
              the gestures, NASA-TLX workload, and EEG engagement index. Study
              2 results showed that immersive VR not only resulted in a
              significantly higher exertion (\%HRmax, calories consumption, and
              Borg RPE) but also helped achieve better positive game experience
              in challenge, flow, sensory and imaginative immersion, as well as
              lower negative affect. We also found that nausea and oculomotor
              were significantly higher in immersive VR. Conclusion: This pilot
              study demonstrates that youth who played gesture-based exergame
              in immersive VR had a higher level of exertion (\%HRmax, calories
              consumption, and Borg RPE), although the number of performed
              gestures were not significantly different. They also felt that
              immersive VR was much more challenging, immersive (flow, sensory
              and imaginative immersion), and had a lower negative affect than
              a 50-inch TV; however, immersive VR was more likely to make youth
              have higher cybersickness.",

               the coiled body-specific protein, p80-coilin. In control animals
               (no estradiol) or in animals 8 h post-injection, each hepatocyte
               nucleus contained an average of 1.0 coiled body (CB), which
               appeared randomly distributed in the nucleoplasm. At 48 h
               post-injection, there were an average of 2.7 CBs/nucleus and
               many of these appeared to be in contact with the nucleolus.
               Pairs of CBs were also observed. By 4 wk post-injection an
               average of 1.5 CBs/nucleus were detected, with no apparent
               relationship to the nucleolus observed. By serial-section
               electron microscopy of intact livers, two different types of
               round NBs were observed, sometimes in close proximity to each
               other and to the expanded interchromatin granule region in
               maximally stimulated cells. One type of NB was a classical CB
               that averaged 0.35 microns in diameter and the other NB type was
               ring shaped, averaged 0.25 microns in diameter, was composed of
               a fibrous shell surrounding a hollow interior, and appeared as a
               simple NB when sectioned tangentially through its outer shell.
               Immunoelectron microscopy revealed that CBs were the only class
               of NBs that contained p80-coilin. From these data, we conclude
               that CBs proliferate in response to estrogen stimulation,

               in number by replicative division.",

               technologies in the workplace and home, and to provide new
               training methods that enhance performance, expand capabilities,

               part of inferior area 6 (area F5) of two macaque monkeys.
               Previous data had shown that neurons of this area discharge
               during goal-directed hand and mouth movements. We describe here
               the properties of a newly discovered set of F5 neurons (``mirror
               neurons', n = 92) all of which became active both when the
               monkey performed a given action and when it observed a similar
               action performed by the experimenter. Mirror neurons, in order
               to be visually triggered, required an interaction between the
               agent of the action and the object of it. The sight of the agent
               alone or of the object alone (three-dimensional objects, food)
               were ineffective. Hand and the mouth were by far the most
               effective agents. The actions most represented among those
               activating mirror neurons were grasping, manipulating and
               placing. In most mirror neurons (92\%) there was a clear
               relation between the visual action they responded to and the
               motor response they coded. In approximately 30\% of mirror
               neurons the congruence was very strict and the effective
               observed and executed actions corresponded both in terms of
               general action (e.g. grasping) and in terms of the way in which
               that action was executed (e.g. precision grip). We conclude by
               proposing that mirror neurons form a system for matching
               observation and execution of motor actions. We discuss the
               possible role of this system in action recognition and, given
               the proposed homology between F5 and human Brocca's region, we
               posit that a matching system, similar to that of mirror neurons

              disease",
  author   = "Leech, Robert and Sharp, David J",
  abstract = "The posterior cingulate cortex is a highly connected and
              metabolically active brain region. Recent studies suggest it has
              an important cognitive role, although there is no consensus about
              what this is. The region is typically discussed as having a
              unitary function because of a common pattern of relative
              deactivation observed during attentionally demanding tasks. One
              influential hypothesis is that the posterior cingulate cortex has
              a central role in supporting internally-directed cognition. It is
              a key node in the default mode network and shows increased
              activity when individuals retrieve autobiographical memories or
              plan for the future, as well as during unconstrained 'rest' when
              activity in the brain is 'free-wheeling'. However, other evidence
              suggests that the region is highly heterogeneous and may play a
              direct role in regulating the focus of attention. In addition,
              its activity varies with arousal state and its interactions with
              other brain networks may be important for conscious awareness.
              Understanding posterior cingulate cortex function is likely to be
              of clinical importance. It is well protected against ischaemic
              stroke, and so there is relatively little neuropsychological data
              about the consequences of focal lesions. However, in other
              conditions abnormalities in the region are clearly linked to
              disease. For example, amyloid deposition and reduced metabolism
              is seen early in Alzheimer's disease. Functional neuroimaging

              psychiatric disorders including Alzheimer's disease,
              schizophrenia, autism, depression and attention deficit
              hyperactivity disorder, as well as ageing. Our own work has
              consistently shown abnormal posterior cingulate cortex function
              following traumatic brain injury, which predicts attentional
              impairments. Here we review the anatomy and physiology of the
              region and how it is affected in a range of clinical conditions,
              before discussing its proposed functions. We synthesize key
              findings into a novel model of the region's function (the
              'Arousal, Balance and Breadth of Attention' model). Dorsal and
              ventral subcomponents are functionally separated and differences
              in regional activity are explained by considering: (i) arousal
              state; (ii) whether attention is focused internally or
              externally; and (iii) the breadth of attentional focus. The
              predictions of the model can be tested within the framework of
              complex dynamic systems theory, and we propose that the dorsal
              posterior cingulate cortex influences attentional focus by
              'tuning' whole-brain metastability and so adjusts how stable
              brain network activity is over time.",

              (MBAT) can improve BCI learning, but how it does so remains

              that incorporate intentional rest. We trained individuals in
              mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR; a standardized MBAT
              intervention) and compared performance and brain activity before
              and after training between randomly assigned trained and
              untrained control groups. The MBAT group showed reliably faster

              Alpha-band activity in electroencephalogram signals, recorded in

              sense of agency is inferred after an action, by
              ``retrospectively'' comparing actual effects of actions against
              their intended effects. In contrast, a ``prospective'' component
              of agency, generated during action selection, and in advance of
              knowing the actual effect, has received less attention. Here, we
              used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate
              prospective contributions of action selection processes to sense
              of agency. To do so, we dissociated action selection processes
              from action-outcome matching, by subliminally priming responses

              control over action effects when the action was compatibly versus
              incompatibly primed. Thus, compatible primes facilitated action
              selection processing, in turn boosting sense of agency over a
              subsequent effect. This prospective contribution of action
              selection processes to sense of agency was accounted for by
              exchange of signals across a prefrontal-parietal network.

  abstract = "Somatosensory input generated by one's actions (i.e.,
              self-initiated body movements) is generally attenuated.
              Conversely, externally caused somatosensory input is enhanced,
              for example, during active touch and the haptic exploration of
              objects. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging
              (fMRI) to ask how the brain accomplishes this delicate weighting
              of self-generated versus externally caused somatosensory
              components. Finger movements were either self-generated by our
              participants or induced by functional electrical stimulation
              (FES) of the same muscles. During half of the trials,
              electrotactile impulses were administered when the (actively or
              passively) moving finger reached a predefined flexion threshold.
              fMRI revealed an interaction effect in the contralateral
              posterior insular cortex (pIC), which responded more strongly to
              touch during self-generated than during FES-induced movements. A
              network analysis via dynamic causal modeling revealed that
              connectivity from the secondary somatosensory cortex via the pIC
              to the supplementary motor area was generally attenuated during
              self-generated relative to FES-induced movements-yet specifically
              enhanced by touch received during self-generated, but not
              FES-induced movements. Together, these results suggest a crucial
              role of the parietal operculum and the posterior insula in
              differentiating self-generated from externally caused
              somatosensory information received from one's moving limb.",

  abstract = "To control our actions efficiently, our brain represents our body

              weighted according to how (un)reliable-how precise-each
              respective modality is in a given context. However, perceptual
              experiments in other modalities suggest that the weights assigned
              to sensory cues are also modulated ``top-down'' by attention.
              Here, we asked whether during action, attention can likewise
              modulate the weights (i.e., precision) assigned to visual versus
              proprioceptive information about body position. Participants
              controlled a virtual hand (VH) via a data glove, matching either
              the VH or their (unseen) real hand (RH) movements to a target,
              and thus adopting a ``visual'' or ``proprioceptive'' attentional
              set, under varying levels of visuo-proprioceptive congruence and
              visibility. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) revealed
              increased activation of the multisensory superior parietal lobe
              (SPL) during the VH task and increased activation of the
              secondary somatosensory cortex (S2) during the RH task. Dynamic
              causal modeling (DCM) showed that these activity changes were the
              result of selective, diametrical gain modulations in the primary
              visual cortex (V1) and the S2. These results suggest that
              endogenous attention can balance the gain of visual versus
              proprioceptive brain areas, thus contextualizing their influence
              on multisensory areas representing the body for action.",

  abstract = "Perceptual awareness depends upon the way in which we engage with
              our sensorium. This notion is central to active inference, a
              theoretical framework that treats perception and action as
              inferential processes. This variational perspective on cognition
              formalizes the notion of perception as hypothesis testing and
              treats actions as experiments that are designed (in part) to
              gather evidence for or against alternative hypotheses. The common
              treatment of perception and action affords a useful
              interpretation of certain perceptual phenomena whose active
              component is often not acknowledged. In this article, we start by
              considering Troxler fading - the dissipation of a peripheral
              percept during maintenance of fixation, and its recovery during
              free (saccadic) exploration. This offers an important example of
              the failure to maintain a percept without actively interrogating
              a visual scene. We argue that this may be understood in terms of
              the accumulation of uncertainty about a hypothesized stimulus
              when free exploration is disrupted by experimental instructions
              or pathology. Once we take this view, we can generalize the idea
              of using bodily (oculomotor) action to resolve uncertainty to
              include the use of mental (attentional) actions for the same
              purpose. This affords a useful way to think about binocular

              however, there is no consensus explanation of this variability.
              Previous studies, focused on the role of multisensory
              integration, have searched for neural correlates of the illusion.
              But those studies have failed to identify a sufficient set of
              functionally specific neural correlates. Because some evidence
              suggests that frontal $\alpha$ power is one means of tracking
              neural instantiations of self, we hypothesized that the higher
              the frontal $\alpha$ power during the eyes-closed resting state,
              the more stable the self. As a corollary, we infer that the more
              stable the self, the less susceptible are participants to a
              blurring of boundaries-to feeling that the rubber hand belongs to
              them. Indeed, we found that frontal $\alpha$ amplitude
              oscillations negatively correlate with susceptibility. Moreover,
              since lower frequencies often modulate higher frequencies, we
              explored the possibility that this might be the case for the RHI.
              Indeed, some evidence suggests that high frontal $\alpha$ power
              observed in low-RHI participants is modulated by $\delta$
              frequency oscillations. We conclude that while neural correlates
              of multisensory integration might be necessary for the RHI,
              sufficient explanation involves variable intrinsic neural

              stimuli with different visual properties and visual complexity
              levels. A total of 80 participants, aged 19-36 years, were
              assigned to either a reading-task (21 men and 19 women) or a
              VR-task (22 men and 18 women) group. Two visual-task groups of
              healthy young adults were matched in age, sex, and handedness.
              All participants were instructed to focus only on the given
              visual tasks and ignore auditory change detection. While
              participants in the reading-task group read text slides, those in
              the VR-task group viewed three 360° VR videos in a random order

              'association' area that combines information from different

              However, until recently little has been known about the neural
              mechanisms responsible for this important cognitive process.
              Recent experiments from the author's laboratory indicate that
              visual, somatosensory, auditory and vestibular signals are
              combined in areas LIP and 7a of the posterior parietal cortex.
              The integration of these signals can represent the locations of
              stimuli with respect to the observer and within the environment.
              Area MSTd combines visual motion signals, similar to those
              generated during an observer's movement through the environment,
              with eye-movement and vestibular signals. This integration
              appears to play a role in specifying the path on which the
              observer is moving. All three cortical areas combine different
              modalities into common spatial frames by using a gain-field
              mechanism. The spatial representations in areas LIP and 7a appear
              to be important for specifying the locations of targets for
              actions such as eye movements or reaching; the spatial

  abstract = "Much of the functioning of the motor system occurs without
              awareness. Nevertheless, we are aware of some aspects of the
              current state of the system and we can prepare and make movements
              in the imagination. These mental representations of the actual
              and possible states of the system are based on two sources:
              sensory signals from skin and muscles, and the stream of motor
              commands that have been issued to the system. Damage to the
              neural substrates of the motor system can lead to abnormalities
              in the awareness of action as well as defects in the control of
              action. We provide a framework for understanding how these
              various abnormalities of awareness can arise. Patients with
              phantom limbs or with anosognosia experience the illusion that
              they can move their limbs. We suggest that these representations
              of movement are based on streams of motor commands rather than
              sensory signals. Patients with utilization behaviour or with
              delusions of control can no longer properly link their intentions
              to their actions. In these cases the impairment lies in the
              representation of intended movements. The location of the neural
              damage associated with these disorders suggests that
              representations of the current and predicted state of the motor
              system are in parietal cortex, while representations of intended

              systems that encode causal structure in the sensorium. Perception
              is equated with the optimization or inversion of these internal

              prescribe the process of recognition, i.e. the dynamics of
              neuronal activity that represent the causes of sensory input.

              landmarks and background cues. Sensory cue integration models
              predict averaging of the two cues, whereas attractor models

              a visual landmark mostly captured the HD signal at low conflicts:
              however, there was an increasing propensity for the cells to
              integrate the cues thereafter. A large conflict presented to
              naive rats resulted in greater visual cue capture (less

              experience. We propose that weighted cue integration in HD cells

              moving within an environment could be decoded from the simulated
              firing of systems of grid cells. Grid cells were modelled with
              Poisson spiking dynamics and organized into multiple 'modules' of
              cells, with firing patterns of similar spatial scale within
              modules and a wide range of spatial scales across modules. The
              number of grid cells per module, the spatial scaling factor
              between modules and the size of the environment were varied.
              Errors in decoded location can take two forms: small errors of
              precision and larger errors resulting from ambiguity in decoding
              periodic firing patterns. With enough cells per module (e.g.
              eight modules of 100 cells each) grid systems are highly robust
              to ambiguity errors, even over ranges much larger than the
              largest grid scale (e.g. over a 500 m range when the maximum grid
              scale is 264 cm). Results did not depend strongly on the precise
              organization of scales across modules (geometric, co-prime or
              random). However, independent spatial noise across modules, which
              would occur if modules receive independent spatial inputs and
              might increase with spatial uncertainty, dramatically degrades
              the performance of the grid system. This effect of spatial
              uncertainty can be mitigated by uniform expansion of grid scales.
              Thus, in the realistic regimes simulated here, the optimal
              overall scale for a grid system represents a trade-off between
              minimizing spatial uncertainty (requiring large scales) and
              maximizing precision (requiring small scales). Within this view,
              the temporary expansion of grid scales observed in novel

                 In the past few years, the organization of the human brain
                 network has been studied extensively using concepts from graph
                 theory, where the brain is represented as a set of nodes
                 connected by edges. This representation of the brain as a
                 connectome can be used to assess important measures that
                 reflect its topological architecture. We have developed a
                 freeware MatLab-based software (BRAPH -- BRain Analysis using
                 graPH theory) for connectivity analysis of brain networks
                 derived from structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),
                 functional MRI (fMRI), positron emission tomography (PET) and
                 electroencephalogram (EEG) data. BRAPH allows building
                 connectivity matrices, calculating global and local network
                 measures, performing non-parametric permutations for group
                 comparisons, assessing the modules in the network, and
                 comparing the results to random networks. By contrast to other
                 toolboxes, it allows performing longitudinal comparisons of
                 the same patients across different points in time.

              information. Here we report an experiment with sixteen
              participants during three recording sessions in which occasional
              visuomotor rotations of varying magnitude occurred during a
              cursor reaching task. We designed a brain-computer interface
              (BCI) to detect ErrP in single trials that provided real-time
              feedback to participants by changing the color of the cursor upon
              ErrP detection. The individual ErrP-BCI decoders exhibited good
              transfer across recording sessions and scalability over the
              varying magnitude of errors. Our results indicate that ErrPs
              encode not only the conscious perception of errors, but also
              their magnitude, in their amplitude and latency. Furthermore, a
              non-linear relationship between the ErrP-BCI output and the

  abstract = "Sense of agency (SoA), the conscious sensation that ``I'' am
              causing my own bodily movements, is a fundamental feature of
              human experience and a core facet of self-awareness. While prior
              work has measured participants' SoA over action consequences
              (e.g., a tone resulting from a button press), the neural
              mechanisms underlying SoA over action itself remains poorly
              understood since control of one's own muscles is normally
              unambiguous. In this work, we preempt subjects' own movements
              during a reaction time task using electrical muscle stimulation
              (EMS). On each trial, subjects report whether their movements
              were self-caused or caused by EMS. Then, by adaptively adjusting
              the timing of EMS delivery using Bayesian Optimization, we caused
              subjects to erroneously attribute roughly half of such
              involuntary (EMS-induced) movements to their own volition.
              Comparing trials with illusory agency to those without a sense of
              agency, we identify multivariate patterns of EEG activity that
              predict trial-by-trial SoA over EMS-caused movements across
              subjects. We show these EEG-derived predictors transition from
              transient to sustained dynamics as predicted by dual-process
              theories of action monitoring. In an exploratory analysis, we
              additionally decode SoA from nonlinear fractal measures of
              trial-by-trial brain activity. Results suggest that while the
              complexity (i.e., fractal dimension) of activity throughout the
              cortex is robustly higher when subjects experience agency over a
              behavior, but electrodes over motor regions appear to be
              selectively less sensitive to local perturbation (i.e.,
              suppressed long-range correlations) when this sense of agency is
              absent. This finding is consistent with an account of SoA as a
              mechanism that gates the motor system from irrelevant sensation.
              Significance Statement Our muscles are the primary means through
              which we affect the external world, and the sense of agency (SoA)
              over action through those muscles is fundamental to
              self-awareness. Disturbances in bodily SoA have been reported in
              some psychiatric and movement disorders; despite the clinical
              importance of understanding the biological basis of SoA, however,
              the mechanisms and functional role of SoA in the neuromuscular
              system are still poorly understood. Drawing on methods from
              human-computer interaction and adaptive experimentation, we
              optimize the timing of electrical muscle stimulation to control
              the perception of agency over electrically-actuated movements
              using human-in-the-loop Bayesian optimization. Using this
              paradigm while subjects undergo EEG recording, we show that early
              (sensorimotor) and late (post-consciousness) neural patterns,
              which show distinct temporal dynamics, both predict illusory SoA
              on a trial-by-trial basis. Moreover, fractal analysis of the EEG
              suggests plausible neural mechanisms for insulating the motor

                 learning is one primary example, which requires both a type of
                 internal model expansion process (adding novel hidden states
                 that explain new observations), and a model reduction process
                 (merging different states into one underlying cause and thus
                 reducing model complexity via meta-learning). Although various
                 algorithmic models of concept learning have been proposed
                 within machine learning and cognitive science, many are
                 limited to various degrees by an inability to generalize, the
                 need for very large amounts of training data, and/or
                 insufficiently established biological plausibility. Using
                 concept learning as an example case, we introduce a novel

                 state-space expansion and reduction - within the active
                 inference framework and its accompanying neural process
                 theory. Our aim is to demonstrate its potential to facilitate
                 a novel line of active inference research in this area. The
                 approach we lay out is based on the idea that a generative
                 model can be equipped with extra (hidden state or cause)
                 'slots' that can be engaged when an agent learns about novel
                 concepts. This can be combined with a Bayesian model reduction
                 process, in which any concept learning - associated with these
                 slots - can be reset in favor of a simpler model with higher
                 model evidence. We use simulations to illustrate this model's
                 ability to add new concepts to its state space (with
                 relatively few observations) and increase the granularity of
                 the concepts it currently possesses. We also simulate the
                 predicted neural basis of these processes. We further show
                 that it can accomplish a simple form of 'one-shot'
                 generalization to new stimuli. Although deliberately simple,
                 these simulation results highlight ways in which active
                 inference could offer useful resources in developing
                 neurocomputational models of structure learning. They provide
                 a template for how future active inference research could

              pattern of retrieval-related activity in lateral posterior

              PPC in subserving goal-directed and reflexive attention, it has
              been hypothesized that PPC activation during retrieval reflects
              the recruitment of parietal attention mechanisms during

              anatomical overlap of retrieval and attention effects in lateral
              PPC. We begin by briefly reviewing the literature implicating
              dorsal PPC in goal-directed attention and ventral PPC in
              reflexive attention. We then discuss the pattern of dorsal and
              ventral PPC activation during episodic retrieval, and conclude
              with consideration of the degree of anatomical convergence across
              the two domains. This assessment revealed that predominantly

               exhibits a deterministic structure during the initial phase of a
               muscle contraction. Features are extracted from several time
               segments of the myoelectric signal to preserve pattern
               structure. These features are then classified using an
               artificial neural network. The control signals are derived from
               natural contraction patterns which can be produced reliably with
               little subject training. The new control scheme increases the
               number of functions which can be controlled by a single channel

              endurance limit was reached. The root mean square (RMS) and mean
              power frequency (MPF) of the EMG signals were calculated. The
              results indicated that both the EMG systems exhibited a
              characteristic progressive increase in EMGRMS and decrease in

              One explanation for this may be that walking at a constant, fixed

              motor actions in order to support the user's impaired
              neuro-muscular system. Recently, it has been suggested that slow

              they offer an accurate time resolution for the provided feedback.

              decoding intention of movements related to walking and arm

               obtained from the gaze from the time component obtained from
               movement. We leverage the latter to isolate the relevant gaze
               information happening just before the movement initiation. We
               evaluated our approach with six healthy individuals using an

               information about trial-to-trial fluctuations considering the
               behavioural performance of subjects. Extracting such sources
               from electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings, however, proves to
               be difficult for most applications as the signal-to-noise ratio
               (SNR) in EEG typically is low. In an offline study with EEG data
               from three healthy subjects, we investigated the use of a
               recently introduced data-driven spatial filtering method called
               Source Power Comodulation (SPoC) [1]. Based on the
               trial-to-trial performance metric of a hand motor task, SPoC
               derives individually optimized linear spatial filters. They are
               optimized such that the resulting oscillatory signal component
               comodulates in band power with the performance metric at an
               increased SNR. Based on short intervals [-800; 0] ms prior to
               the go cue of $\approx$ 200 trials, we were able to identify
               individual oscillatory components. Their alpha band power
               comodulates with the reaction time (RT) during an isometric
               force control task of the hand. Using these components, it is
               possible to reach an average correlation of 0.19, with the best

               Electroencephalography (EEG) is often limited by the lack of
               information regarding the most discriminative channels and
               frequency bands. The paper proposes a Canonical Correlation
               Analysis (CCA) of EEG recorded during bilateral imagined hand
               movement. CCA determines linear transformation of EEG that is
               maximally correlated with a transformed version of neural
               response to imagined movement. In the proposed method, the
               linear weights are identified for the spatial and spectral
               components of EEG signal. The study investigates how the
               CCA-based transformation of the signal improves discrimination
               between two movement classes. Further, two parallel CCA blocks,
               determine two transformations of EEG, one that maximizes
               correlation with the corresponding class, and other that
               minimizes the correlation with the mismatched class. Features
               derived using this approach are used for single-trial
               classification of bilateral imagined hand movement.
               Time-frequency patterns of EEG derived from the proposed

               such models may be useful for a number of applications (e.g.,

              state-of-the-art, fully immersive, 3D, multi-modal VR with
              temporally aligned electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings. The

              Crucially, it does so with simultaneous EEG recordings while
              subjects actively move about a 20 $\times$ 20 ft² space. The
              overall end-to-end latency between real movement and its

              also known to be very sensitive to noise and prone to
              overfitting. To address this issue, it has been recently proposed
              to regularize CSP. In this paper, we present a simple and
              unifying theoretical framework to design such a regularized CSP

              describe how to cast them in this framework. We also propose four

              different RCSP (including the four new ones and the original
              CSP), on electroencephalography data from 17 subjects, from BCI

              paper thus compares performances of different technologies when
              predicting targets of human reaching motions:
              electroencephalography (EEG), electrooculography, camera-based
              eye tracking, electromyography (EMG), hand position, and the
              user's preferences. Supervised machine learning is used to make
              predictions at different points in time (before and during limb
              motion) with each individual sensing modality. Different
              modalities are then combined using an algorithm that takes into
              account the different times at which modalities provide useful
              information. Results show that EEG can make predictions before
              limb motion onset, but requires subject-specific training and
              exhibits decreased performance as the number of possible targets
              increases. EMG and hand position give high accuracy, but only

              possibility of using EMG to detect hand/wrist extension movement
              intention to trigger robot-assisted training in individuals
              without residual movements. METHODS: We compared movement
              intention detection using an EMG detector with a sensorimotor
              rhythm based EEG-BCI using only ipsilesional activity. This was
              carried out on data of 30 severely affected chronic stroke
              patients from a randomized control trial using an EEG-BCI for
              robot-assisted training. RESULTS: The results indicate the
              feasibility of using EMG to detect movement intention in this
              severely handicapped population; probability of detecting EMG
              when patients attempted to move was higher (p 0.001) than at
              rest. Interestingly, 22 out of 30 (or 73\%) patients had
              sufficiently strong EMG in their finger/wrist extensors.
              Furthermore, in patients with detectable EMG, there was poor
              agreement between the EEG and EMG intent detectors, which
              indicates that these modalities may detect different processes.
              CONCLUSION: A substantial segment of severely affected stroke
              patients may benefit from EMG-based assisted therapy. When
              compared to EEG, a surface EMG interface requires less
              preparation time, which is easier to don/doff, and is more
              compact in size. SIGNIFICANCE: This study shows that a large
              proportion of severely affected stroke patients have residual

              human sensorimotor electrocortical dynamics using mobile
              high-density electroencephalography (EEG). METHODS: To overcome
              limitations associated with motion and muscle artifact
              contamination in EEG recordings, we compared solutions for
              artifact removal using novel dual-layer EEG electrodes and
              alternative signal processing methods. Dual-layer EEG
              simultaneously recorded human electrocortical signals and
              isolated motion artifacts using pairs of mechanically coupled and
              electrically independent electrodes. For electrical muscle
              activity removal, we incorporated electromyographic (EMG)
              recordings from the neck into our mobile EEG data processing
              pipeline. We compared artifact removal methods during treadmill
              walking at four speeds (0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 m/s). RESULTS:
              Left and right sensorimotor alpha and beta spectral power
              increased in contralateral limb single support and push off, and
              decreased during contralateral limb swing at each speed. At
              faster walking speeds, sensorimotor spectral power fluctuations
              were less pronounced across the gait cycle with reduced alpha and
              beta power (p < 0.05) compared to slower speeds. Isolated noise
              recordings and neck EMG spectral power fluctuations matched gait
              events and showed broadband spectral power increases at faster
              speeds. CONCLUSION AND SIGNIFICANCE: Dual-layer EEG enabled us to
              isolate changes in human sensorimotor electrocortical dynamics
              across walking speeds. A comparison of signal processing
              approaches revealed similar intrastride cortical fluctuations
              when applying common (e.g., artifact subspace reconstruction) and
              novel artifact rejection methods. Dual-layer EEG, however,

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: High-density surface electromyography (HD-sEMG) has
              been utilized extensively in neuromuscular research. Despite its
              potential advantages, limitations in electrode design have
              largely prevented widespread acceptance of the technology.
              Commercial electrodes have limited spatial fidelity, because of a
              lack of sharpness of the signal, and variable signal stability.
              We demonstrate here a novel tattoo electrode that addresses these
              issues. Our dry HD electrode grid exhibits remarkable
              deformability which ensures superior conformity with the skin
              surface, while faithfully recording signals during different
              levels of muscle contraction. METHOD: We fabricated a 4
              cm$\times$3 cm tattoo HD electrode grid on a stretchable
              electronics membrane for sEMG applications. The grid was placed
              on the skin overlying the biceps brachii of healthy subjects, and
              was used to record signals for several hours while tracking
              different isometric contractions. RESULTS: The sEMG signals were
              recorded successfully from all 64 electrodes across the grid.
              These electrodes were able to faithfully record sEMG signals
              during repeated contractions while maintaining a stable baseline
              at rest. During voluntary contractions, broad EMG frequency
              content was preserved, with accurate reproduction of the EMG
              spectrum across the full signal bandwidth. CONCLUSION: The tattoo
              grid electrode can potentially be used for recording high-density
              sEMG from skin overlying major limb muscles. Layout
              programmability, good signal quality, excellent baseline
              stability, and easy wearability make this electrode a potentially
              valuable component of future HD electrode grid applications.
              SIGNIFICANCE: The tattoo electrode can facilitate high fidelity
              recording in clinical applications such as tracking the evolution

               These studies are limited to controlled settings, a scenario
               that is significantly different from the real world where data

              constraints on volitional motions. Four pneumatic artificial
              muscles were attached to each finger, which formed two
              antagonistic pairs of muscles similar to the human anatomy, and
              thereby, enabled various postural control of the individual
              joints. This unique structure provided 20 DOFs with the
              exoskeleton. A unique adjustable mechanism also allowed for
              fixing the soft exoskeleton suitable for user's hand shape and
              size semi-automatically. Our glove generated static force of
              approximately 8 N at the fingertip, and moved a single finger at
              approximately 10 Hz and all five digits sequentially at 25 Hz.
              Through co-contracting the antagonistic muscles, the fingertip
              force generated by the tapping was increased by 1.5 times.
              Compared with hard exoskeleton gloves, our soft exoskeleton glove
              had lower constraints on the volitional finger motions performed
              by pianists, and also enabled to passively move the fingers
              quicker. Finally, after the soft exoskeleton passively moved the
              fingers so as to play a musical excerpt with the piano over a
              half hour, force variability of the keypresses was reduced when
              playing even without wearing the glove. Passive movement guidance

              undersampling the majority class, and then use the rebalanced
              data to train the classifiers. This leads to interesting
              empirical patterns. In particular, using the rebalanced training
              data can often improve the area under the receiver operating

              different from oneself for the sake of the targeted application
              (e.g., for perspective-taking). In addition, the system can
              partially manipulate the displayed avatar movement through some
              distortion to make the overall experience more enjoyable and
              effective (e.g., training, exercising, rehabilitation). Despite
              its potential, an excessive distortion may become noticeable and
              break the feeling of being embodied into the avatar. Past
              researches have shown that individuals have a relatively high
              tolerance to movement distortions and a great variability of
              individual sensitivities to distortions. In this article, we
              propose a method taking advantage of Reinforcement Learning (RL)
              to efficiently identify the magnitude of the maximum distortion
              that does not get noticed by an individual (further noted the

              with subjects that the RL method finds a more robust detection
              threshold compared to the adaptive staircase method, i.e., it is
              more able to prevent subjects from detecting the distortion when
              its amplitude is equal or below the threshold. Finally, the
              associated majority voting system makes the RL method able to
              handle more noise within the forced choices input than adaptive
              staircase. This last feature is essential for future use with
              physiological signals as these latter are even more susceptible
              to noise. It would then allow to calibrate embodiment

  abstract = "Movement data provide a window - often our only window - into the
              cognitive, social and biological processes that underlie the
              behavioural ecology of animals in the wild. Robust methods for
              identifying and interpreting distinct modes of movement behaviour
              are of great importance, but complicated by the fact that
              movement data are complex, multivariate and dependent. Many
              different approaches to exploratory analysis of movement have
              been developed to answer similar questions, and practitioners are
              often at a loss for how to choose an appropriate tool for a
              specific question. We apply and compare four methodological
              approaches: first passage time (FPT), Bayesian partitioning of
              Markov models (BPMM), behavioural change point analysis (BCPA)
              and a fitted multistate random walk (MRW) to three simulated
              tracks and two animal trajectories - a sea lamprey (Petromyzon
              marinus) tracked for 12 h and a wolf (Canis lupus) tracked for 1
              year. The simulations - in which, respectively, velocity,
              tortuosity and spatial bias change - highlight the sensitivity of
              all methods to model misspecification. Methods that do not
              account for autocorrelation in the movement variables lead to
              spurious change points, while methods that do not account for
              spatial bias completely miss changes in orientation. When applied
              to the animal data, the methods broadly agree on the structure of
              the movement behaviours. Important discrepancies, however,
              reflect differences in the assumptions and nature of the outputs.
              Important trade-offs are between the strength of the a priori
              assumptions (low in BCPA, high in MRW), complexity of output
              (high in the BCPA, low in the BPMM and MRW) and explanatory
              potential (highest in the MRW). The animal track analysis
              suggests some general principles for the exploratory analysis of
              movement data, including ways to exploit the strengths of the
              various methods. We argue for close and detailed exploratory
              analysis of movement before fitting complex movement models.",

              non-realism and poverty of its perceptual elements, it can

              interest for the researcher. Our second argument is that VR

              than by eliciting a true belief of the realism of the VR

              navigating through their environment based on olfactory cues?
              There is not much research on this topic, a gap that the present
              research seeks to bridge. We here provide one of the first
              empirical studies investigating the possibility of using

              participated in a piloting study to determine the olfactory
              material for the main experiment. Then, 24 subjects completed a
              wayfinding experiment with 12 odors as orientation cues. Our
              results are astonishing: Participants were rather good at what we
              call ``odor-based wayfinding.'' This indicates that the ability
              of humans to use olfactory cues for navigation is often
              underestimated. We discuss two different cognitive explanations

              We discuss two ways in which temporal binding has been
              conceptualized. In studies showing temporal binding between a
              voluntary action and its causal consequences, such binding is
              typically interpreted as providing a measure of an implicit or
              pre-reflective ``sense of agency.'' However, temporal binding has
              also been observed in contexts not involving voluntary action,
              but only the passive observation of a cause-effect sequence. In
              those contexts, it has been interpreted as a top-down effect on
              perception reflecting a belief in causality. These two views need
              not be in conflict with one another, if one thinks of them as
              concerning two separate mechanisms through which temporal binding
              can occur. In this paper, we explore an alternative possibility:
              that there is a unitary way of explaining temporal binding both
              within and outside the context of voluntary action as a top-down
              effect on perception reflecting a belief in causality. Any such
              explanation needs to account for ways in which agency, and
              factors connected with agency, has been shown to affect the
              strength of temporal binding. We show that principles of causal
              inference and causal selection already familiar from the
              literature on causal learning have the potential to explain why
              the strength of people's causal beliefs can be affected by the
              extent to which they are themselves actively involved in bringing
              about events, thus in turn affecting binding.",

              Spires-Jones et al., 2016) (Weissgerber et al., 2016), to promote
              better experimental designs and analyses, and educate researchers
              about statistical infer- ences (Kerr, 1998; Wagenmakers, 2007;
              Nieuwenhuis et al., 2011; Button et al., 2013; Head et al.,

              implement. As part of this process we would like to propose a few
              simple steps to improve the assessment of statistical results in
              neurosci- ence, by focusing on detailed graphical
              representations. Despite a potentially sophisticated experimental
              design, in a typical neuroscience experiment, raw continuous data
              tend to undergo drastic simplifications. As a result, it is
              common for the main re- sults of a paper to be summarised in a
              few figures supported by a limited set of statistical tests. Un-
              fortunately, graphical representations in many scientific
              journals, including neuroscience journals, tend to hide
              underlying distributions, with their excessive use of line and
              bar graphs (Allen et al., 2012; Weissgerber et al., 2015). This
              is problematic because common basic summary statistics, such as
              mean and standard deviation, are not robust and simply do not
              provide enough information about a distribution, and can thus
              give misleading impressions about a dataset, particularly for the
              small sample sizes we are accustomed to in neuroscience
              (Anscombe, 1973; Wilcox, 2012). As a con- sequence of
              impoverished data representation, there can be a mismatch between
              the outcome of statistical tests, their interpretations, and the

              coupled oscillators can engage in a large variety of dynamical
              regimes, ranging from synchronization with different phase
              offsets to chaotic behaviour. Which regime prevails depends on
              differences between preferred oscillation frequencies, coupling
              strength and coupling delays. The ability of delay coupled
              oscillator networks to generate a rich repertoire of temporally
              structured activation sequences is exploited by central pattern
              generator networks for the control of movements. However, it is
              less clear whether temporal patterning of neuronal discharges
              also plays a role in cognitive processes. Here, it will be argued
              that the temporal patterning of neuronal discharges emerging from
              delay coupled oscillator networks plays a pivotal role in all
              instances in which selective relations have to be established

              Examples are the dynamic formation of functional networks, the

              the attention-dependent selection of sensory signals, the fast

              that visual evoked responses are enhanced when engaged in a motor
              task that depends on the visual stimulus. To test this, we told
              participants that their brain activity was controlling a video
              game that was in fact the playback of a prerecorded game. The
              deception, which was effective in half of participants, aimed to
              engage the motor system while avoiding evoked responses related
              to actual movement or somatosensation. In other trials, subjects
              actively played the game with keyboard control or passively
              watched a playback. The strength of visually evoked responses was
              measured as the temporal correlation between the continuous

              expense of increasing the complexity of the decoding problem.
              Recent attempts to predict movement speed and force from the
              electroencephalogram (EEG) achieved classification accuracies at
              or slightly above chance levels, highlighting the need for more

              information of motor preparation from the prediction strategies.
              To these ends, a decoding model based on convolutional neural
              networks (ConvNets) was implemented and compared against other

              Furthermore, an analysis of the ConvNet architectures suggests

              AudioMaze, in which participants freely explore a room-sized
              virtual maze, while EEG is recorded synchronized to motion
              capture. Participants (n = 16) were blindfolded and explored
              different mazes, each in three successive trials, using their
              right hand as a probe to ``feel'' for virtual maze walls. When
              their hand ``neared'' a virtual wall, they received directional
              noise feedback. Evidence for spatial learning include shortening
              of time spent and an increase of movement velocity as the same
              maze was repeatedly explored. Theta-band EEG power in or near the
              right lingual gyrus, the posterior portion of the PPA, decreased
              across trials, potentially reflecting the spatial learning.
              Effective connectivity analysis revealed directed information
              flow from the lingual gyrus to the midcingulate cortex, which may
              indicate an updating process that integrates spatial information
              with future action. To conclude, we found behavioral evidence of
              navigational learning in a sparse-AR environment, and a neural
              correlate of navigational learning was found near the lingual
              gyrus.",

              the objective to build and foster a mental spatial representation

              touching otherwise invisible walls that were briefly rendered

              showcase the capabilities of mobile brain/body imaging using VR,

              Following the Mobile Brain/Body Imaging approach, we aimed to
              explore the cortical correlates of landmark-based navigation in
              actively behaving young adults, solving a Y-maze task in
              immersive virtual reality. EEG analysis identified a set of brain
              areas matching state-of-the-art brain imaging literature of

              additionally involved sensorimotor areas related to motor

              amenable to computational modelling that investigates neural
              circuit generating mechanisms and neural population dynamics.
              Because of this, neural oscillations offer an exciting potential
              opportunity for linking theory, physiology and mechanisms of
              cognition. However, despite their prevalence, there are many
              concerns-new and old-about how our analysis assumptions are
              violated by known properties of field potential data. For
              investigations of neural oscillations to be properly interpreted,
              and ultimately developed into mechanistic theories, it is
              necessary to carefully consider the underlying assumptions of the
              methods we employ. Here, we discuss seven methodological
              considerations for analysing neural oscillations. The
              considerations are to (1) verify the presence of oscillations, as
              they may be absent; (2) validate oscillation band definitions, to
              address variable peak frequencies; (3) account for concurrent
              non-oscillatory aperiodic activity, which might otherwise
              confound measures; measure and account for (4) temporal
              variability and (5) waveform shape of neural oscillations, which
              are often bursty and/or nonsinusoidal, potentially leading to
              spurious results; (6) separate spatially overlapping rhythms,
              which may interfere with each other; and (7) consider the
              required signal-to-noise ratio for obtaining reliable estimates.
              For each topic, we provide relevant examples, demonstrate
              potential errors of interpretation, and offer suggestions to
              address these issues. We primarily focus on univariate measures,
              such as power and phase estimates, though we discuss how these
              issues can propagate to multivariate measures. These

              effects of alpha power are often explained in terms of alpha's

              bolstered theories of discrete perceptual cycles, where the
              length of a cycle, or window of integration, is determined by
              alpha frequency. Such studies typically employ visual detection
              paradigms with near-threshold or even illusory stimuli. It is
              unclear whether such results generalize to above-threshold
              stimuli. Here, we recorded EEG, while measuring temporal
              discrimination sensitivity in a temporal-order judgement task

              output. However, little is known about the neural mechanisms that
              underlie such hastened arm responses. One clue may come from
              recent demonstrations that the appearance of a visual target can
              elicit a rapid response in neck muscles that is time-locked to
              target appearance and functionally relevant for orienting gaze

              thought to contribute to 'visual responses' on neck muscles also
              target some arm muscles via a tecto-reticulo-spinal pathway, we
              hypothesized that a similar visual response would be present in
              arm muscles. Our results were consistent with this hypothesis as
              we observed the presence of rapid arm muscle activity (<100 ms

              muscles: (i) was present only when an immediate reach towards the

               alternative to both symbolic/linguistic approaches and purely
               sensorimotor views of cognition, and can account for procedural
               and declarative knowledge manipulation. In accordance with
               recent evidence in cognitive neuroscience and psychology, we
               argue that anticipatory and simulative mechanisms, which arose
               during evolution for action control and not for cognition,
               determined the first form of representational content and were
               exapted for increasingly sophisticated cognitive uses. In
               particular, procedural and declarative forms of knowledge can be
               explained, respectively, in terms of on-line sensorimotor
               anticipation and off-line simulations of potential actions,
               which can give access to tacit knowledge and make it explicit.
               That is, mechanisms that evolved for the on-line prediction of
               the consequences of one's own actions (i.e. forward models)
               determine a (procedural) form of representation, and became
               exapted for off-line use. They can therefore be used to produce
               (declarative) knowledge of the world, by running a simulation of
               the action that would produce the relevant information. We
               conclude by discussing how embodied representations afford a
               form of internal manipulation that can be described as
               internalized situated action.",

  abstract  = "Summary The use of both linear and generalized linear
               mixed-effects models (LMMs and GLMMs) has become popular not
               only in social and medical sciences, but also in biological
               sciences, especially in the field of ecology and evolution.
               Information criteria, such as Akaike Information Criterion
               (AIC), are usually presented as model comparison tools for
               mixed-effects models. The presentation of ?variance explained?
               (R2) as a relevant summarizing statistic of mixed-effects
               models, however, is rare, even though R2 is routinely reported
               for linear models (LMs) and also generalized linear models
               (GLMs). R2 has the extremely useful property of providing an
               absolute value for the goodness-of-fit of a model, which cannot
               be given by the information criteria. As a summary statistic
               that describes the amount of variance explained, R2 can also be
               a quantity of biological interest. One reason for the
               under-appreciation of R2 for mixed-effects models lies in the
               fact that R2 can be defined in a number of ways. Furthermore,
               most definitions of R2 for mixed-effects have theoretical
               problems (e.g. decreased or negative R2 values in larger models)
               and/or their use is hindered by practical difficulties (e.g.
               implementation). Here, we make a case for the importance of
               reporting R2 for mixed-effects models. We first provide the
               common definitions of R2 for LMs and GLMs and discuss the key
               problems associated with calculating R2 for mixed-effects
               models. We then recommend a general and simple method for
               calculating two types of R2 (marginal and conditional R2) for
               both LMMs and GLMMs, which are less susceptible to common
               problems. This method is illustrated by examples and can be
               widely employed by researchers in any fields of research,
               regardless of software packages used for fitting mixed-effects
               models. The proposed method has the potential to facilitate the

               for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach,

               to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It
               calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely
               rejected hypotheses ? the false discovery rate. This error rate
               is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is
               smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of
               the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is
               desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple
               sequential Bonferronitype procedure is proved to control the

               rapidly gaining influence and is set to dominate the science of
               mind and brain in the years to come. PEM has extreme explanatory
               ambition, and profound philosophical implications. Here, I
               assume the theory, briefly explain it, and then I argue that PEM
               implies that the brain is essentially self-evidencing. This
               means it is imperative to identify an evidentiary boundary
               between the brain and its environment. This boundary defines the
               mind-world relation, opens the door to skepticism, and makes the
               mind transpire as more inferentially secluded and
               neurocentrically skull-bound than many would nowadays think.

              The method of ROI selection can critically affect the conclusions
              of a study by causing the researcher to miss effects in the data
              or to detect spurious effects. In practice, to avoid inflating
              Type I error rate (i.e., false positives), ROIs are often based
              on a priori hypotheses or independent information. However, this
              can be insensitive to experiment-specific variations in effect
              location (e.g., latency shifts) reducing power to detect effects.
              Data-driven ROI selection, in contrast, is nonindependent and
              uses the data under analysis to determine ROI positions.
              Therefore, it has potential to select ROIs based on
              experiment-specific information and increase power for detecting
              effects. However, data-driven methods have been criticized
              because they can substantially inflate Type I error rate. Here,
              we demonstrate, using simulations of simple ERP experiments, that
              data-driven ROI selection can indeed be more powerful than a
              priori hypotheses or independent information. Furthermore, we
              show that data-driven ROI selection using the aggregate grand

              hand, can be safely used for ROI selection under many

              conditions, using the AGAT can inflate Type I error and should be
              avoided. We identify critical assumptions for use of the AGAT and
              provide a basis for researchers to use, and reviewers to assess,

              number of trials needed to obtain reliable measures for a variety
              of ERP components. However, these studies have largely ignored
              other variables that affect statistical power in ERP studies,

              influence statistical power, thus providing a better guide for

              standing still periods, consistent with a role in navigation. In

              popular framework for understanding brain function. A key
              component of RL models, prediction error, has been associated
              with neural signals throughout the brain, including subcortical
              nuclei, primary sensory cortices, and prefrontal cortex.
              Depending on the location in which activity is observed, the
              functional interpretation of prediction error may change:
              Prediction errors may reflect a discrepancy in the anticipated
              and actual value of reward, a signal indicating the salience or
              novelty of a stimulus, and many other interpretations. Anterior

              involved in processing behavioral error, and recent computational
              models of the region have expanded this interpretation to include
              a more general role for the region in predicting likely events,

  abstract  = "The human brain is tightly coupled to the world through its
               sensory-motor systems-but it also spends a lot of its metabolism
               talking to itself. One important function of this intrinsic
               activity is the establishment and updating of event
               models-representations of the current situation that can

               Here, we propose that event models largely depend on the default
               network (DN) midline core that includes the posterior cingulate
               and anterior medial prefrontal cortex. An increasing body of
               data indeed suggests that this subnetwork can facilitate stimuli
               processing during both naturalistic event comprehension and
               cognitive tasks in which mental representations of prior
               situations, trials, and task rules can predictively guide
               attention and performance. This midline core involvement in
               supporting predictions through event models can make sense of an

  abstract = "When given a series of sinusoidal oscillations in which the two
              hemicycles have equal amplitude but asymmetric velocity, healthy
              subjects lose perception of the slower hemicycle (SHC), reporting
              a drift towards the faster hemicycle (FHC). This response is not
              reflected in the vestibular-ocular reflex, suggesting that the
              adaptation is of higher order. This study aimed to define EEG
              correlates of this adaptive response. Twenty-five subjects
              underwent a series of symmetric or asymmetric oscillations and
              reported their perceived head orientation at the end using
              landmarks in the testing room; this was converted into total
              position error (TPE). Thirty-two channel EEG was recorded before,
              during and after adaptation. Spectral power and coherence were
              calculated for the alpha, beta, delta and theta frequency bands.
              Linear mixed models were used to determine a region-by-condition
              effect of the adaptation. TPE was significantly greater in the
              asymmetric condition and reported error was always in the
              direction of the FHC. Regardless of condition, alpha
              desynchronised in response to stimulation, then rebounded back
              toward baseline values. This pattern was accelerated and
              attenuated in the prefrontal and occipital regions, respectively,
              in the asymmetric condition. Functional connectivity networks
              were identified in the beta and delta frequency bands; these
              networks, primarily comprising frontoparietal connections, were
              more coherent during asymmetric stimulation. These findings
              suggest that the temporary vestibulo-perceptual 'neglect' induced
              by asymmetric vestibular stimulation may be mediated by alpha
              rhythms and frontoparietal attentional networks. The results
              presented further our understanding of brain rhythms and cortical
              networks involved in vestibular perception and adaptation. KEY
              POINTS: Whole-body asymmetric sinusoidal oscillations, which
              consist of hemicycles with equal amplitude but differing
              velocities, can induce transient 'neglect' of the slower
              hemicycle in the vestibular perception of healthy subjects. In
              this study, we aimed to elucidate EEG correlates of this
              'neglect', thereby identifying a cortical role in vestibular
              perception and adaptation. We identified a
              desynchronisation-resynchronisation response in the alpha
              frequency band (8-14 Hz) that was accelerated in the prefrontal
              region and attenuated in the occipital region when exposed to
              asymmetric, as compared to symmetric, rotations. We additionally
              identified functional connectivity networks in the beta (14-30
              Hz) and delta (1-4 Hz) frequency bands consisting primarily of
              frontoparietal connections. These results suggest a prominent
              role of alpha rhythms and frontoparietal attentional networks in
              vestibular perception and adaptation.",

  abstract  = "The sense of body ownership, knowledge that parts of our body
               `belong' to us, is presumably developed using sensory
               information. Cutaneous signals seem ideal for this and can
               modify the sense of ownership. For example, an illusion of
               ownership over an artificial rubber hand can be induced by
               synchronously stroking both the subject's hidden hand and a
               visible artificial hand. Like cutaneous signals, proprioceptive
               signals (e.g. frommuscle receptors) exclusively signal events
               occurring in the body, but the influence of proprioceptors on
               the sense of body ownership is not known. We developed a
               technique to generate an illusion of ownership over an
               artificial plastic finger, using movement at the proximal
               interphalangeal joint as the stimulus. We then examined this
               illusion in 20 subjects when their index finger was intact and
               when the cutaneous and joint afferents from the finger had been
               blocked by local anaesthesia of the digital nerves. Subjects
               still experienced an illusion of ownership, induced by movement,
               over the plastic finger when the digital nerves were blocked.
               This shows that local cutaneous signals are not essential for
               the illusion and that inputs arising proximally, presumably from
               receptors in muscles which move the finger, can influence the
               sense of body ownership. Contrary to other studies, we found no
               evidence that voluntary movements induce stronger illusions of
               body ownership than those induced by passive movement. It seems
               that the congruence of sensory stimuli ismore important to
               establish body ownership than the presence of multiple sensory
               signals.",

              the free-energy principle and entropic brain hypothesis. We call
              this formulation relaxed beliefs under psychedelics (REBUS) and
              the anarchic brain, founded on the principle that-via their
              entropic effect on spontaneous cortical activity-psychedelics
              work to relax the precision of high-level priors or beliefs,
              thereby liberating bottom-up information flow, particularly via
              intrinsic sources such as the limbic system. We assemble evidence
              for this model and show how it can explain a broad range of
              phenomena associated with the psychedelic experience. With regard
              to their potential therapeutic use, we propose that psychedelics
              work to relax the precision weighting of pathologically
              overweighted priors underpinning various expressions of mental
              illness. We propose that this process entails an increased
              sensitization of high-level priors to bottom-up signaling
              (stemming from intrinsic sources), and that this heightened
              sensitivity enables the potential revision and deweighting of
              overweighted priors. We end by discussing further implications of
              the model, such as that psychedelics can bring about the revision
              of other heavily weighted high-level priors, not directly related
              to mental health, such as those underlying partisan and/or
              overly-confident political, religious, and/or philosophical
              perspectives. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Psychedelics are capturing
              interest, with efforts underway to bring psilocybin therapy to
              marketing authorisation and legal access within a decade,
              spearheaded by the findings of a series of phase 2 trials. In
              this climate, a compelling unified model of how psychedelics
              alter brain function to alter consciousness would have appeal.
              Towards this end, we have sought to integrate a leading model of
              global brain function, hierarchical predictive coding, with an
              often-cited model of the acute action of psychedelics, the
              entropic brain hypothesis. The resulting synthesis states that
              psychedelics work to relax high-level priors, sensitising them to
              liberated bottom-up information flow, which, with the right
              intention, care provision and context, can help guide and

              through augmentation. This vision not only depends on
              technological innovations but also critically relies on our
              brain's ability to learn, adapt, and interface with augmentation
              devices. Here, we investigated whether successful motor
              augmentation with an extra robotic thumb can be achieved and what
              its implications are on the neural representation and function of
              the biological hand. Able-bodied participants were trained to use
              an extra robotic thumb (called the Third Thumb) over 5 days,
              including both lab-based and unstructured daily use. We
              challenged participants to complete normally bimanual tasks using
              only the augmented hand and examined their ability to develop
              hand-robot interactions. Participants were tested on a variety of
              behavioral and brain imaging tests, designed to interrogate the
              augmented hand's representation before and after the training.
              Training improved Third Thumb motor control, dexterity, and
              hand-robot coordination, even when cognitive load was increased
              or when vision was occluded. It also resulted in increased sense
              of embodiment over the Third Thumb. Consequently, augmentation
              influenced key aspects of hand representation and motor control.
              Third Thumb usage weakened natural kinematic synergies of the
              biological hand. Furthermore, brain decoding revealed a mild
              collapse of the augmented hand's motor representation after
              training, even while the Third Thumb was not worn. Together, our
              findings demonstrate that motor augmentation can be readily
              achieved, with potential for flexible use, reduced cognitive
              reliance, and increased sense of embodiment. Yet, augmentation
              may incur changes to the biological hand representation. Such
              neurocognitive consequences are crucial for successful

               primarily focused on monitoring physical parameters such as

               Here, we introduce an artificial intelligence-powered multimodal
               robotic sensing system (M-Bot) with an all-printed
               mass-producible soft electronic skin-based human-machine
               interface. A scalable inkjet printing technology with
               custom-developed nanomaterial inks was used to manufacture
               flexible physicochemical sensor arrays for electrophysiology
               recording, tactile perception, and robotic sensing of a wide
               range of hazardous materials including nitroaromatic explosives,
               pesticides, nerve agents, and infectious pathogens such as
               SARS-CoV-2. The M-Bot decodes the surface electromyography
               signals collected from the human body through machine learning
               algorithms for remote robotic control and can perform in situ
               threat compound detection in extreme or contaminated
               environments with user-interactive tactile and threat alarm

               technology can be further generalized and applied to other
               remote sensing platforms. Such diversity was validated on an
               intelligent multimodal robotic boat platform that can
               efficiently track the source of trace amounts of hazardous
               compounds through autonomous and intelligent decision-making

               properties (``bottom-up factors'') using abstract stimuli. Here,
               we demonstrate that cognitive (``top-down'') mechanisms like
               ecological relevance and presence evoked by a virtual
               environment can also enhance visually induced self-motion
               illusions (vection). In two experiments, naive observers were
               asked to rate presence and the onset, intensity, and
               convincingness of circular vection induced by different rotating
               visual stimuli presented on a curved projection screen (FOV: 54°
               $\times$ 45°). Globally consistent stimuli depicting a natural
               3D scene proved more effective in inducing vection and presence
               than inconsistent (scrambled) or unnatural (upside-down) stimuli
               with similar physical stimulus properties. Correlation analyses
               suggest a direct relationship between spatial presence and

               the spatial reference frame evoked by the naturalistic
               environment increased the believability of the visual stimulus,
               such that it was more easily accepted as a stable ``scene'' with
               respect to which visual motion is more likely to be judged as
               self-motion than object motion. This work extends our

               environment (VE) systems has been proposed in earlier work,
               based on the concept of simulation. One system (A) is said to be
               more immersive than another (B) if A can be used to simulate an
               application as if it were running on B. Here we show how this
               concept can be used as the basis for a psychophysics of presence
               in VEs, the sensation of being in the place depicted by the
               virtual environment displays (Place Illusion, PI), and also the
               illusion that events occurring in the virtual environment are
               real (Plausibility Illusion, Psi). The new methodology involves
               matching experiments akin to those in color science. Twenty
               participants first experienced PI or Psi in the initial highest
               level immersive system, and then in 5 different trials chose
               transitions from lower to higher order systems and declared a
               match whenever they felt the same level of PI or Psi as they had
               in the initial system. In each transition they could change the
               type of illumination model used, or the field-of-view, or the
               display type (powerwall or HMD) or the extent of
               self-representation by an avatar. The results showed that the 10
               participants instructed to choose transitions to attain a level
               of PI corresponding to that in the initial system tended to
               first choose a wide field-of-view and headmounted display, and
               then ensure that they had a virtual body that moved as they did.
               The other 10 in the Psi group concentrated far more on achieving
               a higher level of illumination realism, although having a
               virtual body representation was important for both groups. This
               methodology is offered as a way forward in the evaluation of the
               responses of people to immersive virtual environments, a unified

               the spatial-time domain approach via codeword sequence matching,

  abstract  = "Force feedback devices resist miniaturization, because they
               require physical motors and mechanics. We propose mobile force
               feedback by eliminating motors and instead actuating the user's
               muscles using electrical stimulation. Without the motors, we
               obtain substantially smaller and more energy-efficient devices.
               We present a prototype that fits on the back of a mobile phone.
               It actuates users' forearm muscles via four electrodes, which
               causes users' muscles to contract involuntarily, so that they
               tilt the device sideways. As users resist this motion using
               their other arm, they perceive force feedback. We demonstrate
               the interaction at the example of an interactive videogame in
               which users steer an airplane through winds rendered using force
               feedback. In a first user study, we found our device to cause
               users to produce up to 18.7N of force, when used to actuate
               their palm flexors. In a second study, participants played the

               considered reinforcement learning frameworks were human

               brain signals related to the perception of errors by humans. In
               particular, we consider error potentials (ErrP), voltage
               deflections appearing when a user perceives an error, either
               committed by herself or by an external machine, thus encoding
               binary information about how a robot is performing a task. Based

               pose of their own body. We have implemented a wearable device
               called Pose-IO that offers input and output based on
               proprioception. Users communicate with Pose-IO through the pose
               of their wrists. Users enter information by performing an input
               gesture by flexing their wrist, which the device senses using a
               3-axis accelerometer. Users receive output from Pose-IO by
               find-ing their wrist posed in an output gesture, which Pose-IO
               actuates using electrical muscle stimulation. This mechanism
               allows users to interact with Pose-IO without visual or auditory

               performed the experiment in both the real and the virtual
               scenarios. For the VR case, participants can see both their own
               animated avatar and the avatar of the other participant in the
               environment. As they move, we store their trajectories to obtain
               information regarding speeds, clearance distances and task
               completion times. For the VR scenario, we also wanted to
               evaluate whether the users were aware of subtle differences in
               the avatar's animations and foot steps sounds. We ran the same
               experiment under three different conditions: (1) synchronizing
               the avatar's feet animation and sound of footsteps with the
               movement of the participant; (2) synchronizing the animation but
               not the sound and finally (3) not synchronizing either one. The

               off-the-shelf electromyography (EMG) sensors. We present results
               from three studies to advance our fundamental understanding of
               the opportunities that EMG brings in object interaction
               recognition. In the first study, we investigated the influence
               of physical properties of objects such as shape, size, and
               weight on EMG signals. We also conducted a thorough exploration
               of the feature spaces and sensor positions which can provide a
               solid base to rely on for future designers and practitioners for
               such interactive technique. In the second study, we assessed the
               feasibility and accuracy of inferring the types of grasped
               objects via using forearm muscular activity as a cue. Our
               results indicate that the types of objects can be recognized

               to interact with objects as they would naturally. Our approach

               characteristic of VR is creating presence, the experience of
               'being' or 'acting', when physically situated in another place.
               Measuring presence is vital for VR research and development. It
               is typically repeatedly assessed through questionnaires
               completed after leaving a VR scene. Requiring participants to
               leave and re-enter the VR costs time and can cause
               disorientation. In this paper, we investigate the effect of
               completing presence questionnaires directly in VR. Thirty-six
               participants experienced two immersion levels and filled three
               standardized presence questionnaires in the real world or VR. We

                     room-scale, it is often desirable to increase users'
                     perceived walking speed, for which we investigate three
                     methods. (1) Ground-Level Scaling increases users' avatar
                     size, allowing them to walk farther. (2) Eye-Level Scaling
                     enables users to walk through a World in Miniature, while
                     maintaining a street-level view. (3) Seven-League Boots

                     Seven-League Boots, unlike the other two methods,
                     diminishes positional accuracy at high gains, and users
                     modify their walking behavior to compensate for the lack

               they preemptively move the user to perform a task, such as to
               improve movement performance (e.g., EMS-assisted drumming).
               Unfortunately, when using preemptive force-feedback users do not
               feel in control and loose their sense of agency. We address this
               by actuating the user's body, using EMS, within a particular
               time window (160 ms after visual stimulus), which we found to
               speed up reaction time by 80 ms in our first study. With this
               preemptive timing, when the user and system move congruently,
               the user feels that they initiated the motion, yet their

               certain scents, such as the coolness of mint or hotness of
               peppers. These odors trigger not only the olfactory bulb, but
               also the nose's trigeminal nerve, which has receptors that
               respond to both temperature and chemicals. To exploit this, we
               engineered a wearable device based on micropumps and an atomizer
               that emits up to three custom-made ``thermal'' scents directly
               to the user's nose. Breathing in these scents causes the user to

               walk across the road to the opposite sidewalk. During that time,
               the assessment of participant movement behavior was captured by
               the use of objective measurements (time, speed, and deviation).
               Five density conditions (no density, low density, medium
               density, high density, and extreme density) were developed to
               investigate which had the greatest effect on the movement
               behavior of the participants. The results obtained indicated
               that the extreme density condition of the virtual crowd did

               (EMS), have the unique potential to accelerate users' own
               reaction time (RT). However, this speedup has only been explored
               while the device is attached to the user. In fact, very little
               is known regarding whether this faster reaction time still
               occurs after the user removes the device from their bodies--this
               is precisely what we investigated by means of a simple reaction
               time (RT) experiment, in which participants were asked to tap as
               soon as they saw an LED flashing. Participants experienced this
               in three EMS conditions: (1) fast-EMS, the electrical impulses
               were synced with the LED; (2) agency-EMS, the electrical impulse
               was delivered 40ms faster than the participant's own RT, which
               prior work has shown to preserve one's sense of agency over this
               movement; and, (3) late-EMS: the impulse was delivered after the
               participant's own RT. Our results revealed that the
               participants' RT was significantly reduced by approximately 8ms
               (up to 20ms) only after training with the agency-EMS condition.
               This finding suggests that the prioritizing agency during EMS
               training is key to motor-adaptation, i.e., it enables a faster
               motor response even after the user has removed the EMS device

               allows interactive EMS-based devices to flex the user's fingers
               independently of each other. EMS is a promising technique for
               force feedback because of its small form factor when compared to
               mechanical actuators. However, the current EMS approach to
               flexing the user's fingers (i.e., attaching electrodes to the
               base of the forearm, where finger muscles anchor) is limited by
               its inability to flex a target finger's metacarpophalangeal
               (MCP) joint independently of the other fingers. In other words,
               current EMS devices cannot flex one finger alone, they always
               induce unwanted actuation to adjacent fingers. To tackle the
               lack of dexterity, we propose and validate a new electrode
               layout that places the electrodes on the back of the hand, where
               they stimulate the interossei/lumbricals muscles in the palm,
               which have never received attention with regards to EMS. In our
               user study, we found that our technique offers four key benefits
               when compared to existing EMS electrode layouts: our technique
               (1) flexes all four fingers around the MCP joint more
               independently; (2) has less unwanted flexion of other joints
               (such as the proximal interphalangeal joint); (3) is more robust

               our EMS technique enables applications for interactive EMS
               systems that require a level of flexion dexterity not available
               until now. We demonstrate the improved dexterity with four
               example applications: three musical instrumental tutorials
               (piano, drum, and guitar) and a VR application that renders
               force feedback in individual fingers while manipulating a yo-yo.",

               that miniaturizes force feedback, especially popular for
               untethered haptic devices, such as mobile gaming, VR, or AR.
               However, the actuation displayed by interactive systems based on
               EMS is coarse and imprecise. EMS systems mostly focus on
               inducing movements in large muscle groups such as legs, arms,
               and wrists; whereas individual finger poses, which would be
               required, for example, to actuate a user's fingers to
               fingerspell even the simplest letters in sign language, are not
               possible. The lack of dexterity in EMS stems from two
               fundamental limitations: (1) lack of independence: when a
               particular finger is actuated by EMS, the current runs through
               nearby muscles, causing unwanted actuation of adjacent fingers;
               and, (2) unwanted oscillations: while it is relatively easy for
               EMS to start moving a finger, it is very hard for EMS to stop
               and hold that finger at a precise angle; because, to stop a
               finger, virtually all EMS systems contract the opposing muscle,
               typically achieved via controllers (e.g., PID)---unfortunately,
               even with the best controller tuning, this often results in
               unwanted oscillations. To tackle these limitations, we propose
               dextrEMS, an EMS-based haptic device featuring mechanical brakes
               attached to each finger joint. The key idea behind dextrEMS is
               that while the EMS actuates the fingers, it is our mechanical
               brake that stops the finger in a precise position. Moreover, it
               is also the brakes that allow dextrEMS to select which fingers
               are moved by EMS, eliminating unwanted movements by preventing
               adjacent fingers from moving. We implemented dextrEMS as an
               untethered haptic device, weighing only 68g, that actuates eight
               finger joints independently (metacarpophalangeal and proximal
               interphalangeal joints for four fingers), which we demonstrate
               in a wide range of haptic applications, such as assisted
               fingerspelling, a piano tutorial, guitar tutorial, and a VR
               game. Finally, in our technical evaluation, we found that
               dextrEMS outperformed EMS alone by doubling its independence and
               reducing unwanted oscillations.",

               object manipulation, even if it is virtual. This distinction is
               important, as literature has shown that in the physical world,
               action-enabled and gesture-enabled learning produce distinct
               cognitive outcomes. This study attempts to understand whether
               sensorimotor-embodied interactions with objects in IVR can

               human-computer interaction. Control has been investigated mainly
               at a high level, using subjective questionnaire data, but also
               at a low level, using objective data on participants' sense of
               agency. However, it remains unclear how differences in higher
               level, experienced control reflect lower level sense of control.
               We study that link in two experiments. In the first one we
               measure the low-level sense of agency with button, touchpad, and
               on-skin input. The results show a higher sense of agency with
               on-skin input. In the second experiment, participants played a
               simple game controlled with the same three inputs. We find that
               on-skin input results in both increased sense and experience of
               control compared to touchpad input. However, the corresponding
               difference is not found between on-skin and button input,
               whereas the button performed better in the experiment task.
               These results suggest that other factors of user experience

               intersection are unclear, as are the benefits of combining XR
               and AI. This paper presents a scoping review that highlights how
               XR is applied in AI research and vice versa. We screened 2619
               publications from 203 international venues published between
               2017 and 2021, followed by an in-depth review of 311 papers.
               Based on our review, we identify five main topics at the
               intersection of XR and AI, showing how research at the
               intersection can benefit each other. Furthermore, we present a
               list of commonly used datasets, software, libraries, and models

               a plausible sense of physicality into the virtual world remains
               challenging. Closing the gap between real-world physicality and
               immersive virtual experience requires a closed interaction loop:
               applying user-exerted physical forces to the virtual environment
               and generating haptic sensations back to the users. However,
               existing VR/AR solutions either completely ignore the force
               inputs from the users or rely on obtrusive sensing devices that
               compromise user experience.By identifying users' muscle
               activation patterns while engaging in VR/AR, we design a
               learning-based neural interface for natural and intuitive force
               inputs. Specifically, we show that lightweight electromyography
               sensors, resting non-invasively on users' forearm skin, inform
               and establish a robust understanding of their complex hand
               activities. Fuelled by a neural-network-based model, our
               interface can decode finger-wise forces in real-time with 3.3\%
               mean error, and generalize to new users with little calibration.
               Through an interactive psychophysical study, we show that human
               perception of virtual objects' physical properties, such as
               stiffness, can be significantly enhanced by our interface. We
               further demonstrate that our interface enables ubiquitous
               control via finger tapping. Ultimately, we envision our findings

  abstract  = "Humans have been developing and playing musical instruments for
               millennia. With technological advancements, instruments were
               becoming ever more sophisticated. In recent decades
               computer-supported innovations have also been introduced in
               hardware design, usability, and aesthetics. One of the most
               commonly digitally augmented instruments is the piano. Besides
               electronic keyboards, several prototypes augmenting pianos with
               different projections providing various levels of interactivity
               on and around the keyboard have been implemented in order to
               support piano players. However, it is still unclear whether
               these solutions support the learning process. In this paper, we
               present a systematic review of augmented piano prototypes
               focusing on instrument learning based on the four themes derived
               from interviews with piano experts to understand better the
               problems of teaching the piano. These themes are (i)
               synchronised movement and body posture, (ii) sight-reading,
               (iii) ensuring motivation, and (iv) encouraging improvisation.
               We found that prototypes are saturated on the synchronisation
               themes, and there are opportunities for sight-reading,
               motivation, and improvisation themes. We conclude by presenting
               recommendations on augmenting piano systems towards enriching

                     structure in motion. We approach this problem with a
                     data-driven methodology for modularizing a motion stream
                     (or time-series of human motion) into a vocabulary of

              first problem is that sensory feedback is noisy and delayed,
              which can make movements inaccurate and unstable. The second
              problem is that the relationship between a motor command and the
              movement it produces is variable, as the body and the environment
              can both change. A solution is to build adaptive internal models
              of the body and the world. The predictions of these internal
              models, called forward models because they transform motor
              commands into sensory consequences, can be used to both produce a
              lifetime of calibrated movements, and to improve the ability of
              the sensory system to estimate the state of the body and the
              world around it. Forward models are only useful if they produce

              conditioning, rats can encode both the specific action-outcome
              associations to which they are exposed and the degree to which an
              action is causal in producing its associated outcome. Three
              experiments assessed the involvement of the hippocampus in
              encoding these aspects of instrumental learning. In each study,
              rats with electrolytic lesions of the dorsal hippocampus and
              sham-lesioned controls were trained while hungry to press two
              levers, each of which delivered a unique food outcome.
              Experiments 1A and 1B used an outcome devaluation procedure to
              assess the effects of the lesion on encoding the action-outcome
              relationship. After training, one of the two outcomes was
              devalued using a specific satiety procedure, after which
              performance on the two levers was assessed in a choice extinction
              test. The lesion had no detectable effect on either the
              acquisition of instrumental performance or on the rats'
              sensitivity to outcome devaluation; lesion and sham groups both
              reduced responding on the lever associated with the devalued
              outcome compared with the other lever. In experiment 2, the
              sensitivity of hippocampal rats to the causal efficacy of their
              actions was assessed by selectively degrading the contingency
              between one of the actions and its associated outcome. Whereas
              sham rats selectively reduced performance on the lever for which
              the action-outcome contingency had been degraded, hippocampal
              rats did not. These results suggest that, in instrumental
              conditioning, lesions of the dorsal hippocampus selectively
              impair the ability of rats to represent the causal relationship

              been considered to be too noise prone to allow recording of brain
              dynamics during human locomotion. Here we applied a channel-based
              artifact template regression procedure and a subsequent spatial
              filtering approach to remove gait-related movement artifact from
              EEG signals recorded during walking and running. We first used
              stride time warping to remove gait artifact from high-density EEG
              recorded during a visual oddball discrimination task performed
              while walking and running. Next, we applied infomax independent
              component analysis (ICA) to parse the channel-based noise reduced
              EEG signals into maximally independent components (ICs) and then
              performed component-based template regression. Applying
              channel-based or channel-based plus component-based artifact
              rejection significantly reduced EEG spectral power in the 1.5- to
              8.5-Hz frequency range during walking and running. In walking

              event-related potentials (ERPs), which were nearly identical to
              visual oddball discrimination events while standing, were visible
              before and after applying noise reduction. In the running
              condition, gait-related artifact severely compromised the EEG
              signals: stable average ERP time-courses of IC processes were
              only detectable after artifact removal. These findings show that
              high-density EEG can be used to study brain dynamics during whole
              body movements and that mechanical artifact from rhythmic gait
              events may be minimized using a template regression procedure.",

              might rely on two distinct signals: a sensory prediction error or
              a motor correction. Sensory prediction errors occur when an
              initial motor command is generated but the predicted sensory
              consequences do not match the observed values. In some tasks,
              these sensory errors are monitored and result in on-line
              corrective motor output as the movement progresses. Here we asked
              whether cerebellum-dependent adaptation of reaching relies on
              sensory or on-line motor corrections. Healthy controls and people
              with hereditary cerebellar ataxia reached during a visuomotor
              perturbation in two conditions: ``shooting'' movements without
              on-line corrections and ``pointing'' movements that allowed for
              on-line corrections. Sensory (i.e., visual) errors were available

              corrections did not influence adaptation in control subjects,
              suggesting that only sensory errors were needed for learning.
              Cerebellar subjects were comparably impaired in both adaptation
              conditions relative to controls, despite abnormal and
              inconsistent on-line motor correction. Specifically, poor on-line
              motor corrections were unrelated to cerebellar subjects'
              adaptation deficit (i.e., adaptation did not worsen), further
              suggesting that only sensory prediction errors influence this
              process. Therefore adaptation to visuomotor perturbations depends

              strong temporal and spatial constraints. The purpose of this
              study was to determine fundamental patterns of covariation of
              motion across joints and digits of the human hand. Joint motion
              was recorded while 5 expert pianists played 30 excerpts from
              musical pieces, which featured ∼50 different tone sequences and
              fingering. Principal component analysis and cluster analysis
              using an expectation-maximization algorithm revealed that joint
              velocities could be categorized into several patterns, which help
              to simplify the description of the movements of the multiple
              degrees of freedom of the hand. For the thumb keystroke, two
              distinct patterns of joint movement covariation emerged and they
              depended on the spatiotemporal patterns of the task. For example,
              the thumb-under maneuver was clearly separated into two clusters
              based on the direction of hand translation along the keyboard.
              While the pattern of the thumb joint velocities differed between
              these clusters, the motions at the metacarpo-phalangeal and
              proximal-phalangeal joints of the four fingers were more
              consistent. For a keystroke executed with one of the fingers,
              there were three distinct patterns of joint rotations, across
              which motion at the striking finger was fairly consistent, but
              motion of the other fingers was more variable. Furthermore, the

              were studied. Unit responses recorded when the head was free to
              move were compared with responses recorded when the head was
              restrained from moving. WBR in the absence of a visual target
              evoked a compensatory vestibulocollic reflex (VCR) that
              effectively reduced the head velocity in space by an average of
              33 +/- 14\%. In 73 units, the compensatory head movements were
              sufficiently large to permit the effect of the VCR on vestibular
              signal processing to be assessed quantitatively. The VCR affected
              the rotational responses of different vestibular neurons in
              different ways. Approximately one-half of the units (34/73, 47\%)
              had responses that decreased as head velocity decreased. However,
              the responses of many other units (24/73) showed little change.
              These cells had signals that were better correlated with trunk
              velocity than with head velocity. The remaining units had
              responses that were significantly larger (15/73, 21\%) when the
              VCR produced a decrease in head velocity. Eye-movement-related
              units tended to have rotational responses that were correlated
              with head velocity. On the other hand, non-eye-movement units
              tended to have rotational responses that were better correlated
              with trunk velocity. We conclude that sensory vestibular signals
              are transformed from head-in-space coordinates to trunk-in-space
              coordinates on many secondary vestibular neurons in the
              vestibular nuclei by the addition of inputs related to head
              rotation on the trunk. This coordinate transformation is
              presumably important for controlling postural reflexes and
              constructing a central percept of body orientation and movement
              in space.",

  abstract = "We examine how oscillations in the intracranial
              electroencephalogram (iEEG) relate to human maze learning. Theta-
              band activity (4-12 Hz in rodents; 4-8 Hz in humans) plays a
              significant role in memory function in rodents and in humans.
              Recording intracranially in humans, we have reported
              task-related, theta-band rhythmic activity in the raw trace
              during virtual maze learning and during a nonspatial working
              memory task. Here we analyze oscillations during virtual maze
              learning across a much broader range of frequencies and analyze
              their relationship to two task variables relevant to learning. We
              describe a new algorithm for detecting oscillatory episodes that
              takes advantage of the high signal-to-noise ratio and high
              temporal resolution of the iEEG. Accounting for the background
              power spectrum of the iEEG, the algorithm allows us to directly
              compare levels of oscillatory activity across frequencies within
              the 2- to 45-Hz band. We report that while episodes of
              oscillatory activity are found at various frequencies, most of
              the rhythmic activity during virtual maze learning occurs within
              the theta band. Theta oscillations are more prevalent when the
              task is made more difficult (manipulation of maze length).
              However, these oscillations do not tend to covary significantly
              with decision time, a good index of encoding and retrieval
              operations. In contrast, lower- and higher-frequency oscillations
              do covary with this variable. These results suggest that while
              human cortically recorded theta might play a role in encoding,
              the overall levels of theta oscillations tell us little about the
              immediate demands on encoding or retrieval. Finally, different
              patterns of oscillations may reflect distinct underlying aspects

              melodies, harmony chord, and music syntax. In this vein, we

              and attention. Recently, alpha decrease has been associated with
              externally directed attention, especially in the visual domain,
              whereas alpha increase has been related to internal processing
              such as mental arithmetic. However, the role of alpha
              oscillations and how the different components of a task
              (processing of external stimuli, internal
              manipulation/representation, and task demand) interact to affect
              alpha power are still unclear. Here, we investigate how alpha
              power is differently modulated by attentional tasks depending
              both on task difficulty (less/more demanding task) and direction
              of attention (internal/external). To this aim, we designed two
              experiments that differently manipulated these aspects.
              Experiment 1, outside Virtual Reality (VR), involved two tasks
              both requiring internal and external attentional components
              (intake of visual items for their internal manipulation) but with
              different internal task demands (arithmetic vs. reading).
              Experiment 2 took advantage of the VR (mimicking an aircraft
              cabin interior) to manipulate attention direction: it included a
              condition of VR immersion only, characterized by visual external
              attention, and a condition of a purely mental arithmetic task
              during VR immersion, requiring neglect of sensory stimuli.
              Results show that: (1) In line with previous studies, visual
              external attention caused a significant alpha decrease,
              especially in parieto-occipital regions; (2) Alpha decrease was
              significantly larger during the more demanding arithmetic task,
              when the task was driven by external visual stimuli; (3) Alpha
              dramatically increased during the purely mental task in VR
              immersion, whereby the external stimuli had no relation with the
              task. Our results suggest that alpha power is crucial to isolate
              a subject from the environment, and move attention from external
              to internal cues. Moreover, they emphasize that the emerging use
              of VR associated with EEG may have important implications to
              study brain rhythms and support the design of artificial systems.",

               respondents with an online questionnaire. The results suggested
               that colorfulness of yesterday's experiences was associated with
               the extent to which a person accomplished their tasks, and also
               associated with yesterday being a ``good'', ``pleasant'', but
               not frustrating day. The meaning lessness of this analysis
               illustrates that the equivalent methodology used by presence
               researchers, may, similarly, bring into being the idea of
               presence in the minds of VE participants. However, it is argued
               that there can be no evidence on this methodological basis that
               presence played any role in their actual mental activity or
               behavior at the time of the experience. It is concluded that
               presence researchers must move away from heavy reliance on
               questionnaires in order to make any progress in this area.",

               indicate the direction to these target objects from a terminal
               location in the maze (from which the objects could no longer be
               seen). Subjects controlled their motion through the mazes using
               three locomotion modes. In the Walk mode, subjects walked
               normally in the experimental room. For each subject, body
               position and heading were tracked, and the tracking information
               was used to continuously update the visual imagery presented to
               the subjects on a head-mounted display. This process created the
               impression of immersion in the experimental maze. In the Visual
               Turn mode subjects moved through the environment using a
               joystick to control their turning. The only sensory information
               subjects received about rotation and translation was that
               provided by the computer-generated imagery. The Real Turn mode
               was midway between the other two modes, in that subjects
               physically turned in place to steer while translating in the
               virtual maze; thus translation through the maze was signaled
               only by the computer-generated imagery, whereas rotations were
               signaled by the imagery as well as by proprioceptive and
               vestibular information. The dependent measure in the experiment
               was the absolute error of the subject's directional estimate to
               each target from the terminal location. Performance in the Walk
               mode was significantly better than in the Visual Turn mode but
               other trends were not significant. A secondary finding was that
               the degree of motion sickness depended upon locomotion mode,
               with the lowest incidence occurring in the Walk mode. Both
               findings suggest the advisability of having subjects explore

               one place or environment, even when one is physically situated
               in another.) We believe that presence is a normal awareness

               interaction between sensory stimulation, environmental factors
               that encourage involvement and enable immersion, and internal

               Teleoperators and Virtual Environments. We used these factors
               and others as the basis for a presence questionnaire (PQ) to
               measure presence in VEs. In addition we developed an immersive

               between presence and task performance in VEs; individual

              impacts on human engagement and ``immersion,'' are both
              academically and technologically challenging. While many
              researchers have, in the past, focused on the affective
              evaluation of passive environments, such as listening to music or

              stimuli. This article reports the first stage (focusing on
              participants' subjective responses) of a range of experimental
              investigations supporting the evaluation of emotional responses
              within a virtual environment, according to a three-dimensional
              (Valence, Arousal, and Dominance) model of affects, developed in
              the 1970s and 1980s. To populate this three-dimensional model
              with participants' emotional responses, an ``affective VR,''
              capable of manipulating users' emotions, has been designed and
              subjectively evaluated. The VR takes the form of a dynamic
              ``speedboat'' simulation, elements (controllable VR parameters)
              of which were assessed and selected based on a 35-respondent
              online survey, coupled with the implementation of an affective
              power approximation algorithm. A further 68 participants took
              part in a series of trials, interacting with a number of VR
              variations, while subjectively rating their emotional responses.
              The experimental results provide an early level of confidence
              that this particular affective VR is capable of manipulating
              individuals' emotional experiences, through the control of its
              internal parameters. Moreover, the approximation technique proved
              to be fairly reliable in predicting users' potential emotional
              responses, in various affective VR settings, prior to actual
              experiences. Finally, the analysis suggested that the emotional
              response of the users, with different gender and gaming
              experiences, could vary, when presented with the same affective
              VR situation.",

              both theoretical and experimental approaches problematic.
              Nevertheless, exploitation of immersive virtual reality has
              allowed a reframing of this question to whether it is possible to

              by referring to the Sense of Embodiment (SoE). Due to the
              conceptual confusion around this sense, we provide a working
              definition which states that SoE consists of three subcomponents:
              the sense of self-location, the sense of agency, and the sense of
              body ownership. Under this proposed structure, measures and
              experimental manipulations reported in the literature are
              reviewed and related challenges are outlined. Finally, future

              investigated the neural mechanisms underlying the processing of
              auditory feedback manipulations in pianists. To disentangle
              effects of action-based and perception-based expectations, we

              pianists performed bimanually sequences on a piano, while at
              random positions, the auditory feedback of single notes was
              manipulated, thereby creating a mismatch between an expected and

              pianists listened to tone sequences containing the same
              manipulations (perception condition). The manipulations in the

              task-irrelevant (Experiment 2). In action and perception
              conditions, event-related potentials elicited by manipulated
              tones showed an early fronto-central negativity around 200 msec,

              deflection (P3a). The early negativity was more pronounced during
              the action compared to the perception condition. This shows that
              during performance, the intention to produce specific auditory

               technique with functional imaging can provide important
               information on many aspects of spatial navigation, it is
               important to recognize some of the limitations these techniques
               have for gaining a complete understanding of the neural
               mechanisms of navigation. Foremost among these is that, when
               participants perform a virtual navigation task in a scanner,
               they are lying motionless in a supine position while viewing a
               video monitor. Here, we provide evidence that spatial
               orientation and navigation rely to a large extent on locomotion
               and its accompanying activation of motor, vestibular, and
               proprioceptive systems. Researchers should therefore consider
               the impact on the absence of these motion-based systems when
               interpreting virtual navigation/functional imaging experiments
               to achieve a more accurate understanding of the mechanisms
               underlying navigation.",

              how changes in neural activity relate to voluntary-``free
              will''-movement. The readiness potential (RP) is observed in the
              EEG as a slow-building signal that precedes action onset. Many
              consider the RP as a marker of an underlying preparatory process
              for initiating voluntary movement. However, the RP may emerge
              from ongoing slow-wave brain oscillations that influence the
              timing of movement initiation in a phase-dependent manner.
              Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) enables brain
              oscillations to be entrained at the frequency of stimulation. We
              delivered tACS at a slow-wave frequency over frontocentral motor
              areas while participants (n = 30) performed a simple, self-paced
              button press task. During the active tACS condition, participants
              showed a tendency to initiate actions in the phase of the tACS
              cycle that corresponded to increased negative potentials across
              the frontocentral motor region. Comparisons of premovement EEG
              activity observed over frontocentral and central scalp electrodes
              showed earlier onset and increased amplitude of RPs from active
              stimulation compared with sham stimulation. This suggests that
              movement-related activity in the brain can be modulated by the
              delivery of weak, nonconsciously perceptible alternating currents
              over frontocentral motor regions. We present novel findings that
              support existing theories, which suggest the timing of voluntary
              movement is influenced by the phase of slow-changing oscillating
              brain states.",

              Under these conditions, information maximization has extra
              properties not found in the linear case (Linsker 1989). The
              nonlinearities in the transfer function are able to pick up

              something akin to true redundancy reduction between units in the

               that is how sensory inputs to the human participant are
               processed internally. The therapeutic technique known as
               neurolinguistic programming (NLP) is used as a basis for
               measuring such internal factors. NLP uses the idea of
               representation systems (visual, auditory, and kinesthetic) and
               perceptual position (egocentric or exocentric) to code
               subjective experience. The paper also considers one external
               factor, that is how the virtual environment represents a
               participant---either as a complete body, or just an arrow cursor
               that responds to hand movements. A case-control pilot experiment

              the difficulty of the underlying information-processing task. In
              the case of object color, retinal information about object
              reflectance is confounded with information about the illumination
              as well as about the object's shape and pose. There is no obvious

              differentiate between relevant and irrelevant errors. Behavioral
              adaptations are only reasonable when an error is attributed to
              one's own behavior and therefore regarded as relevant for
              subsequent adjustments, whereas irrelevant errors caused by
              unsystematic external influences should be disregarded. Here, we
              ask whether error predictions as indexed by the error-related

              cognitive tasks. Although there is no consensus as to its precise
              function, evidence from both human and animal studies clearly

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The present paper examines the visual processing
              speed of complex objects, here faces, by mapping the relationship
              between object physical properties and single-trial brain
              responses. Measuring visual processing speed is challenging
              because uncontrolled physical differences that co-vary with
              object categories might affect brain measurements, thus biasing
              our speed estimates. Recently, we demonstrated that early
              event-related potential (ERP) differences between faces and
              objects are preserved even when images differ only in phase
              information, and amplitude spectra are equated across image
              categories. Here, we use a parametric design to study how early
              ERP to faces are shaped by phase information. Subjects performed
              a two-alternative force choice discrimination between two faces
              (Experiment 1) or textures (two control experiments). All stimuli
              had the same amplitude spectrum and were presented at 11 phase
              noise levels, varying from 0\% to 100\% in 10\% increments, using
              a linear phase interpolation technique. Single-trial ERP data
              from each subject were analysed using a multiple linear
              regression model. RESULTS: Our results show that sensitivity to
              phase noise in faces emerges progressively in a short time window
              between the P1 and the N170 ERP visual components. The
              sensitivity to phase noise starts at about 120-130 ms after
              stimulus onset and continues for another 25-40 ms. This result
              was robust both within and across subjects. A control experiment
              using pink noise textures, which had the same second-order
              statistics as the faces used in Experiment 1, demonstrated that
              the sensitivity to phase noise observed for faces cannot be
              explained by the presence of global image structure alone. A
              second control experiment used wavelet textures that were matched
              to the face stimuli in terms of second- and higher-order image
              statistics. Results from this experiment suggest that
              higher-order statistics of faces are necessary but not sufficient
              to obtain the sensitivity to phase noise function observed in
              response to faces. CONCLUSION: Our results constitute the first
              quantitative assessment of the time course of phase information
              processing by the human visual brain. We interpret our results in

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Bridging the gap between laboratory brain-computer
              interface (BCI) demonstrations and real-life applications has
              gained increasing attention nowadays in translational

              using a low-cost, ease-of-use electroencephalogram (EEG) headset
              for monitoring individuals' EEG signals in their natural
              head/body positions and movements. This study aimed to assess the
              feasibility of using a consumer-level EEG headset to realize an
              online steady-state visual-evoked potential (SSVEP)-based BCI
              during human walking. METHODS: This study adopted a 14-channel
              Emotiv EEG headset to implement a four-target online SSVEP
              decoding system, and included treadmill walking at the speeds of
              0.45, 0.89, and 1.34 meters per second (m/s) to initiate the
              walking locomotion. Seventeen participants were instructed to
              perform the online BCI tasks while standing or walking on the
              treadmill. To maintain a constant viewing distance to the visual
              targets, participants held the hand-grip of the treadmill during
              the experiment. Along with online BCI performance, the concurrent
              SSVEP signals were recorded for offline assessment. RESULTS:
              Despite walking-related attenuation of SSVEPs, the online BCI
              obtained an information transfer rate (ITR) over 12 bits/min
              during slow walking (below 0.89 m/s). CONCLUSIONS: SSVEP-based
              BCI systems are deployable to users in treadmill walking that
              mimics natural walking rather than in highly-controlled
              laboratory settings. This study considerably promotes the use of
              a consumer-level EEG headset towards the real-life BCI

  author   = "Lau, Troy M and Gwin, Joseph T and Ferris, Daniel P",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Considerable effort has been devoted to mapping the
              functional and effective connectivity of the human brain, but
              these efforts have largely been limited to tasks involving
              stationary subjects. Recent advances with high-density
              electroencephalography (EEG) and Independent Components Analysis
              (ICA) have enabled study of electrocortical activity during human
              locomotion. The goal of this work was to measure the effective
              connectivity of cortical activity during human standing and
              walking. METHODS: We recorded 248-channels of EEG as eight young
              healthy subjects stood and walked on a treadmill both while
              performing a visual oddball discrimination task and not
              performing the task. ICA parsed underlying electrocortical,
              electromyographic, and artifact sources from the EEG signals.
              Inverse source modeling methods and clustering algorithms
              localized posterior, anterior, prefrontal, left sensorimotor, and
              right sensorimotor clusters of electrocortical sources across
              subjects. We applied a directional measure of connectivity,
              conditional Granger causality, to determine the effective
              connectivity between electrocortical sources. RESULTS:
              Connections involving sensorimotor clusters were weaker for
              walking than standing regardless of whether the subject was
              performing the simultaneous cognitive task or not. This finding
              supports the idea that cortical involvement during standing is
              greater than during walking, possibly because spinal neural
              networks play a greater role in locomotor control than standing
              control. Conversely, effective connectivity involving
              non-sensorimotor areas was stronger for walking than standing
              when subjects were engaged in the simultaneous cognitive task.
              CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that standing results in greater
              functional connectivity between sensorimotor cortical areas than
              walking does. Greater cognitive attention to standing posture
              than to walking control could be one interpretation of that
              finding. These techniques could be applied to clinical
              populations during gait to better investigate neural substrates

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The aim of electroencephalogram (EEG) source
              localization is to find the brain areas responsible for EEG waves
              of interest. It consists of solving forward and inverse problems.
              The forward problem is solved by starting from a given electrical
              source and calculating the potentials at the electrodes. These
              evaluations are necessary to solve the inverse problem which is
              defined as finding brain sources which are responsible for the
              measured potentials at the EEG electrodes. METHODS: While other
              reviews give an extensive summary of the both forward and inverse
              problem, this review article focuses on different aspects of
              solving the forward problem and it is intended for newcomers in
              this research field. RESULTS: It starts with focusing on the
              generators of the EEG: the post-synaptic potentials in the apical
              dendrites of pyramidal neurons. These cells generate an
              extracellular current which can be modeled by Poisson's
              differential equation, and Neumann and Dirichlet boundary
              conditions. The compartments in which these currents flow can be
              anisotropic (e.g. skull and white matter). In a three-shell
              spherical head model an analytical expression exists to solve the
              forward problem. During the last two decades researchers have
              tried to solve Poisson's equation in a realistically shaped head
              model obtained from 3D medical images, which requires numerical
              methods. The following methods are compared with each other: the
              boundary element method (BEM), the finite element method (FEM)
              and the finite difference method (FDM). In the last two methods
              anisotropic conducting compartments can conveniently be
              introduced. Then the focus will be set on the use of reciprocity
              in EEG source localization. It is introduced to speed up the
              forward calculations which are here performed for each electrode
              position rather than for each dipole position. Solving Poisson's
              equation utilizing FEM and FDM corresponds to solving a large
              sparse linear system. Iterative methods are required to solve
              these sparse linear systems. The following iterative methods are
              discussed: successive over-relaxation, conjugate gradients method
              and algebraic multigrid method. CONCLUSION: Solving the forward
              problem has been well documented in the past decades. In the past
              simplified spherical head models are used, whereas nowadays a
              combination of imaging modalities are used to accurately describe
              the geometry of the head model. Efforts have been done on
              realistically describing the shape of the head model, as well as
              the heterogenity of the tissue types and realistically
              determining the conductivity. However, the determination and
              validation of the in vivo conductivity values is still an
              important topic in this field. In addition, more studies have to
              be done on the influence of all the parameters of the head model
              and of the numerical techniques on the solution of the forward
              problem.",

  author   = "Winkler, Irene and Haufe, Stefan and Tangermann, Michael",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Artifacts contained in EEG recordings hamper both,
              the visual interpretation by experts as well as the algorithmic
              processing and analysis (e.g. for Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI)
              or for Mental State Monitoring). While hand-optimized selection
              of source components derived from Independent Component Analysis
              (ICA) to clean EEG data is widespread, the field could greatly
              profit from automated solutions based on Machine Learning
              methods. Existing ICA-based removal strategies depend on explicit
              recordings of an individual's artifacts or have not been shown to
              reliably identify muscle artifacts. METHODS: We propose an
              automatic method for the classification of general artifactual
              source components. They are estimated by TDSEP, an ICA method
              that takes temporal correlations into account. The linear
              classifier is based on an optimized feature subset determined by
              a Linear Programming Machine (LPM). The subset is composed of
              features from the frequency-, the spatial- and temporal domain. A
              subject independent classifier was trained on 640 TDSEP
              components (reaction time (RT) study, n = 12) that were hand
              labeled by experts as artifactual or brain sources and tested on
              1080 new components of RT data of the same study. Generalization
              was tested on new data from two studies (auditory Event Related
              Potential (ERP) paradigm, n = 18; motor imagery BCI paradigm, n =
              80) that used data with different channel setups and from new
              subjects. RESULTS: Based on six features only, the optimized
              linear classifier performed on level with the inter-expert
              disagreement (<10\% Mean Squared Error (MSE)) on the RT data. On
              data of the auditory ERP study, the same pre-calculated
              classifier generalized well and achieved 15\% MSE. On data of the
              motor imagery paradigm, we demonstrate that the discriminant
              information used for BCI is preserved when removing up to 60\% of
              the most artifactual source components. CONCLUSIONS: We propose a
              universal and efficient classifier of ICA components for the
              subject independent removal of artifacts from EEG data. Based on
              linear methods, it is applicable for different electrode
              placements and supports the introspection of results. Trained on
              expert ratings of large data sets, it is not restricted to the
              detection of eye- and muscle artifacts. Its performance and
              generalization ability is demonstrated on data of different EEG

              sense of being present in a virtual environment, emerges if an
              individual perceives himself as 1) if he were actually located
              (self-location) and 2) able to act in the virtual environment
              (possible actions). In this study, two main media factors
              (perspective and agency) were investigated while participants
              played a commercially available video game. METHODS: The
              differences in SP experience and associated brain activation were
              compared between the conditions of game play in first person
              perspective (1PP) and third person perspective (3PP) as well as
              between agency, i.e., active navigation of the video game
              character (active), and non-agency, i.e., mere passive
              observation (passive). SP was assessed using standard
              questionnaires, and brain activation was measured using
              electroencephalography (EEG) and sLORETA source localisation
              (standard low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography).
              RESULTS: Higher SP ratings were obtained in the 1PP compared with
              the 3PP condition and in the active compared with the passive
              condition. On a neural level, we observed in the 1PP compared
              with the 3PP condition significantly less alpha band power in the

              wearing a lower limb exoskeleton in order to generate an
              emergency stop command for the exoskeleton. This would enhance
              the user-exoskeleton interaction, improving the safety mechanisms
              of current exoskeletons. METHODS: In order to detect the change
              in the brain activity when an obstacle suddenly appears,
              different features of EEG signals are evaluated using the
              recordings of five healthy subjects. Since the change in the
              brain activity occurs in the time domain, the features evaluated
              are: common spatial patterns, average power, slope, and the
              coefficients of a polynomial fit. A Linear Discriminant
              Analysis-based classifier is used to differentiate between two
              conditions: the appearance or not of an obstacle. The evaluation
              of the performance to detect the obstacles is made in terms of
              accuracy, true positive (TP) and false positive (FP) rates.
              RESULTS: From the offline analysis, the best performance is
              achieved when the slope or the polynomial coefficients are used
              as features, with average detection accuracy rates of 74.0 and
              79.5 \%, respectively. These results are consistent with the
              pseudo-online results, where a complete EEG recording is
              segmented into windows of 500 ms and overlapped 400 ms, and a
              decision about the obstacle appearance is made for each window.
              The results of the best subject were 11 out of 14 obstacles
              detected with a rate of 9.09 FPs/min, and 10 out of 14 obstacles
              detected with a rate of 6.34 FPs/min using slope and polynomial
              coefficients features, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: An EEG-based
              BCI can be developed to detect the appearance of unexpected
              obstacles. The average accuracy achieved is 79.5 \% of success
              rate with a low number of false detections. Thus, the online
              performance of the BCI would be suitable for commanding in a
              safely way a lower limb exoskeleton during walking.",

               must be provided with human-robot interfaces and smart
               algorithms capable to identify the user's movement intentions.
               Surface electromyographic (sEMG) signals could be suitable for
               this purpose, but their applicability in shared control schemes
               for real-time operation of assistive devices in daily-life
               activities is limited due to high inter-subject variability,
               which requires custom calibrations and training. Here, we
               developed a machine-learning-based algorithm for detecting the
               user's motion intention based on electromyographic signals, and
               discussed its applicability for controlling an upper-limb
               exoskeleton for people with severe arm disabilities. METHODS:
               Ten healthy participants, sitting in front of a screen while
               wearing the exoskeleton, were asked to perform several reaching
               movements toward three LEDs, presented in a random order. EMG
               signals from seven upper-limb muscles were recorded. Data were
               analyzed offline and used to develop an algorithm that
               identifies the onset of the movement across two different
               events: moving from a resting position toward the LED
               (Go-forward), and going back to resting position (Go-backward).
               A set of subject-independent time-domain EMG features was
               selected according to information theory and their probability
               distributions corresponding to rest and movement phases were
               modeled by means of a two-component Gaussian Mixture Model
               (GMM). The detection of movement onset by two types of detectors
               was tested: the first type based on features extracted from
               single muscles, whereas the second from multiple muscles. Their
               performances in terms of sensitivity, specificity and latency
               were assessed for the two events with a leave one-subject out
               test method. RESULTS: The onset of movement was detected with a
               maximum sensitivity of 89.3\% for Go-forward and 60.9\% for
               Go-backward events. Best performances in terms of specificity
               were 96.2 and 94.3\% respectively. For both events the algorithm
               was able to detect the onset before the actual movement, while
               computational load was compatible with real-time applications.
               CONCLUSIONS: The detection performances and the low
               computational load make the proposed algorithm promising for the
               control of upper-limb exoskeletons in real-time applications.
               Fast initial calibration makes it also suitable for helping

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Virtual reality (VR) offers unprecedented opportunity
              as a scientific tool to study visuomotor interactions, training,
              and rehabilitation applications. However, it remains unclear if
              haptic-free hand-object interactions in a virtual environment
              (VE) may differ from those performed in the physical environment
              (PE). We therefore sought to establish if the coordination
              structure between the transport and grasp components remain
              similar whether a reach-to-grasp movement is performed in PE and
              VE. METHOD: Reach-to-grasp kinematics were examined in 13 healthy
              right-handed young adults. Subjects were instructed to
              reach-to-grasp-to-lift three differently sized rectangular
              objects located at three different distances from the starting
              position. Object size and location were matched between the two
              environments. Contact with the virtual objects was based on a
              custom collision detection algorithm. Differences between the
              environments were evaluated by comparing movement kinematics of
              the transport and grasp components. RESULTS: Correlation
              coefficients, and the slope of the regression lines, between the
              reach and grasp components were similar for the two environments.
              Likewise, the kinematic profiles of the transport velocity and
              grasp aperture were strongly correlated across the two
              environments. A rmANOVA further identified some similarities and
              differences in the movement kinematics between the two
              environments - most prominently that the closure phase of
              reach-to-grasp movement was prolonged when movements were
              performed in VE. CONCLUSIONS: Reach-to-grasp movement patterns
              performed in a VE showed both similarities and specific
              differences compared to those performed in PE. Additionally, we
              demonstrate a novel approach for parsing the reach-to-grasp
              movement into three phases- initiation, shaping, closure- based
              on established kinematic variables, and demonstrate that the
              differences in performance between the environments are
              attributed to the closure phase. We discuss this in the context
              of how collision detection parameters may modify hand-object
              interactions in VE. Our study shows that haptic-free VE may be a
              useful platform to study reach-to-grasp movements, with potential
              implications for haptic-free VR in neurorehabilitation.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The purpose of augmentative exoskeletons is to help
              people exceed the limitations of their human bodies, but this
              cannot be realized unless people choose to use these exciting
              technologies. Although human walking efficiency has been highly
              optimized over generations, exoskeletons have been able to
              consistently improve this efficiency by 10-15\%. However, despite
              these measurable improvements, exoskeletons today remain confined
              to the laboratory. To achieve widespread adoption, exoskeletons
              must not only exceed the efficiency of human walking, but also
              provide a perceivable benefit to their wearers. METHODS: In this
              study, we quantify the perceptual threshold of the metabolic
              efficiency benefit provided during exoskeleton-assisted
              locomotion. Ten participants wore bilateral ankle exoskeletons
              during continuous walking. The assistance provided by the
              exoskeletons was varied in 2 min intervals while participants
              provided feedback on their metabolic rate. These data were
              aggregated and used to estimate the perceptual threshold.
              RESULTS: Participants were able to detect a change in their
              metabolic rate of 22.7\% (SD: 17.0\%) with 75\% accuracy. This
              indicates that in the short term and on average, wearers cannot
              yet reliably perceive the metabolic benefits of today's
              augmentative exoskeletons. CONCLUSIONS: If wearers cannot
              perceive the benefits provided by these technologies, it will
              negatively affect their impact, including long-term adoption and
              product viability. Future exoskeleton researchers and designers

               related to their ability to effectively find their way through
               environments, such as neighborhoods and cities, but is also
               related to the speed and accuracy with which they learn new
               environments. In the current literature, it is unclear whether
               the cognitive skills underlying SOD require intentional
               cognitive effort to produce accurate knowledge of a new
               environment. The cognitive skills underlying SOD could exert
               their influence automatically-without conscious intention-or
               they might need to be intentionally and effortfully applied.
               Determining the intentionality of acquiring environmental
               spatial knowledge would shed light on whether individuals with a
               poor SOD can be trained to use the skill set of an individual
               with good SOD, thereby improving their wayfinding and spatial
               learning. Therefore, this research investigates the accuracy of
               spatial knowledge acquisition during a walk through a previously
               unfamiliar neighborhood by individuals with differing levels of
               self-assessed SOD, as a function of whether their spatial
               learning was intentional or incidental. After walking a route
               through the neighborhood, participants completed landmark,
               route, and survey knowledge tasks. SOD was related to the
               accuracy of acquired spatial knowledge, as has been found
               previously. However, learning intentionality did not affect
               spatial knowledge acquisition, neither as a main effect nor in
               interaction with SOD. This research reveals that while the
               accuracy of spatial knowledge acquired via direct travel through
               an environment is validly measured by self-reported SOD, the
               spatial skills behind a good SOD appear to operate with or

               Participants controlled a thermal-hydraulic process simulation

               the participants used a human-computer interface that presented

  abstract = "Older adults often experience serious problems in spatial
              navigation, and alterations in underlying brain structures are
              among the first indicators for a progression to neurodegenerative
              diseases. Studies investigating the neural mechanisms of spatial
              navigation and its changes across the adult lifespan are
              increasingly using virtual reality (VR) paradigms. VR offers
              major benefits in terms of ecological validity, experimental
              control and options to track behavioral responses. However,
              navigation in the real world differs from navigation in VR in
              several aspects. In addition, the importance of body-based or
              visual cues for navigation varies between animal species.
              Incongruences between sensory and motor input in VR might
              consequently affect their performance to a different degree.
              After discussing the specifics of using VR in spatial navigation
              research across species, we outline several challenges when
              investigating age-related deficits in spatial navigation with the

              debate as to their role in sensory processing. Commonly, it is
              assumed that a neuron's role is to encode the stimulus at the
              tuning curve peak, because high firing rates are the neuron's
              most distinct responses. In contrast, many theoretical and
              empirical studies have noted that nearby stimuli are most easily
              discriminated in high-slope regions of the tuning curve. Here, we
              demonstrate that both intuitions are correct, but that their
              relative importance depends on the experimental context and the
              level of variability in the neuronal response. Using three

              Individual differences in the length of a theta cycle (ranging
              between 4 and 7 Hz) might determine how many gamma cycles (>30

              characterization of the brain's mechanisms for learning to make
              advantageous choices. An important problem, though, is how
              complex tasks can be represented in a way that enables efficient
              learning. We consider this problem through the lens of spatial
              navigation, examining how two of the brain's location
              representations--hippocampal place cells and entorhinal grid
              cells--are adapted to serve as basis functions for approximating
              value over space for RL. Although much previous work has focused
              on these systems' roles in combining upstream sensory cues to
              track location, revisiting these representations with a focus on
              how they support this downstream decision function offers
              complementary insights into their characteristics. Rather than
              localization, the key problem in learning is generalization
              between past and present situations, which may not match
              perfectly. Accordingly, although neural populations collectively
              offer a precise representation of position, our simulations of
              navigational tasks verify the suggestion that RL gains efficiency
              from the more diffuse tuning of individual neurons, which allows
              learning about rewards to generalize over longer distances given
              fewer training experiences. However, work on generalization in RL
              suggests the underlying representation should respect the
              environment's layout. In particular, although it is often assumed
              that neurons track location in Euclidean coordinates (that a
              place cell's activity declines ``as the crow flies'' away from
              its peak), the relevant metric for value is geodesic: the
              distance along a path, around any obstacles. We formalize this
              intuition and present simulations showing how Euclidean, but not
              geodesic, representations can interfere with RL by generalizing
              inappropriately across barriers. Our proposal that place and grid
              responses should be modulated by geodesic distances suggests
              novel predictions about how obstacles should affect spatial

  abstract = "This paper shows that the various computations underlying spatial
              cognition can be implemented using statistical inference in a
              single probabilistic model. Inference is implemented using a
              common set of 'lower-level' computations involving forward and
              backward inference over time. For example, to estimate where you
              are in a known environment, forward inference is used to
              optimally combine location estimates from path integration with
              those from sensory input. To decide which way to turn to reach a
              goal, forward inference is used to compute the likelihood of
              reaching that goal under each option. To work out which
              environment you are in, forward inference is used to compute the
              likelihood of sensory observations under the different
              hypotheses. For reaching sensory goals that require a chaining
              together of decisions, forward inference can be used to compute a
              state trajectory that will lead to that goal, and backward
              inference to refine the route and estimate control signals that
              produce the required trajectory. We propose that these
              computations are reflected in recent findings of pattern replay
              in the mammalian brain. Specifically, that theta sequences
              reflect decision making, theta flickering reflects model
              selection, and remote replay reflects route and motor planning.
              We also propose a mapping of the above computational processes

  abstract = "Neuronal population codes are increasingly being investigated
              with multivariate pattern-information analyses. A key challenge
              is to use measured brain-activity patterns to test computational
              models of brain information processing. One approach to this
              problem is representational similarity analysis (RSA), which
              characterizes a representation in a brain or computational model
              by the distance matrix of the response patterns elicited by a set
              of stimuli. The representational distance matrix encapsulates
              what distinctions between stimuli are emphasized and what
              distinctions are de-emphasized in the representation. A model is
              tested by comparing the representational distance matrix it
              predicts to that of a measured brain region. RSA also enables us
              to compare representations between stages of processing within a
              given brain or model, between brain and behavioral data, and
              between individuals and species. Here, we introduce a Matlab
              toolbox for RSA. The toolbox supports an analysis approach that
              is simultaneously data- and hypothesis-driven. It is designed to
              help integrate a wide range of computational models into the
              analysis of multichannel brain-activity measurements as provided
              by modern functional imaging and neuronal recording techniques.
              Tools for visualization and inference enable the user to relate
              sets of models to sets of brain regions and to statistically test
              and compare the models using nonparametric inference methods. The
              toolbox supports searchlight-based RSA, to continuously map a
              measured brain volume in search of a neuronal population code
              with a specific geometry. Finally, we introduce the
              linear-discriminant t value as a measure of representational
              discriminability that bridges the gap between linear decoding
              analyses and RSA. In order to demonstrate the capabilities of the
              toolbox, we apply it to both simulated and real fMRI data. The
              key functions are equally applicable to other modalities of
              brain-activity measurement. The toolbox is freely available to

  abstract  = "Representational models specify how activity patterns in
               populations of neurons (or, more generally, in multivariate
               brain-activity measurements) relate to sensory stimuli, motor
               responses, or cognitive processes. In an experimental context,
               representational models can be defined as hypotheses about the
               distribution of activity profiles across experimental
               conditions. Currently, three different methods are being used to
               test such hypotheses: encoding analysis, pattern component
               modeling (PCM), and representational similarity analysis (RSA).
               Here we develop a common mathematical framework for
               understanding the relationship of these three methods, which
               share one core commonality: all three evaluate the second moment
               of the distribution of activity profiles, which determines the
               representational geometry, and thus how well any feature can be
               decoded from population activity. Using simulated data for three
               different experimental designs, we compare the power of the
               methods to adjudicate between competing representational models.
               PCM implements a likelihood-ratio test and therefore provides
               the most powerful test if its assumptions hold. However, the
               other two approaches-when conducted appropriately-can perform
               similarly. In encoding analysis, the linear model needs to be
               appropriately regularized, which effectively imposes a prior on
               the activity profiles. With such a prior, an encoding model
               specifies a well-defined distribution of activity profiles. In
               RSA, the unequal variances and statistical dependencies of the
               dissimilarity estimates need to be taken into account to reach
               near-optimal power in inference. The three methods render
               different aspects of the information explicit (e.g.
               single-response tuning in encoding analysis and
               population-response representational dissimilarity in RSA) and
               have specific advantages in terms of computational demands, ease
               of use, and extensibility. The three methods are properly
               construed as complementary components of a single
               data-analytical toolkit for understanding neural representations
               on the basis of multivariate brain-activity data.",

              lend empirical support to Heidegger's phenomenology and more
              specifically his description of the transition between
              ready-to-hand and unready-to-hand modes in interactions with
              tools. In experiment 1, we found that a smoothly coping cognitive
              system exhibits type positively correlated noise and that its
              correlated character is reduced when the system is perturbed.
              This indicates that the participant and tool constitute a

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Our body schema gives the subjective impression of
              being highly stable. However, a number of easily-evoked illusions
              illustrate its remarkable malleability. In the rubber-hand
              illusion, illusory ownership of a rubber-hand is evoked by
              synchronous visual and tactile stimulation on a visible rubber
              arm and on the hidden real arm. Ownership is concurrent with a
              proprioceptive illusion of displacement of the arm position
              towards the fake arm. We have previously shown that this illusion
              of ownership plus the proprioceptive displacement also occurs
              towards a virtual 3D projection of an arm when the appropriate
              synchronous visuotactile stimulation is provided. Our objective
              here was to explore whether these illusions (ownership and
              proprioceptive displacement) can be induced by only synchronous
              visuomotor stimulation, in the absence of tactile stimulation.
              METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To achieve this we used a
              data-glove that uses sensors transmitting the positions of
              fingers to a virtually projected hand in the synchronous but not
              in the asynchronous condition. The illusion of ownership was
              measured by means of questionnaires. Questions related to
              ownership gave significantly larger values for the synchronous
              than for the asynchronous condition. Proprioceptive displacement
              provided an objective measure of the illusion and had a median
              value of 3.5 cm difference between the synchronous and
              asynchronous conditions. In addition, the correlation between the
              feeling of ownership of the virtual arm and the size of the drift
              was significant. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We conclude that
              synchrony between visual and proprioceptive information along
              with motor activity is able to induce an illusion of ownership
              over a virtual arm. This has implications regarding the brain
              mechanisms underlying body ownership as well as the use of
              virtual bodies in therapies and rehabilitation.",

              paradoxical experiences. For example, the subjective ordering of
              successive unseen tactile stimuli delivered to the two arms can
              be affected when people cross them. A growing body of evidence
              now highlights the role played by the parietal cortex in
              spatio-temporal information processing when sensory stimuli are
              delivered to the body or when actions are executed; however,
              little is known about the neural basis of such paradoxical
              feelings resulting from such unusual limb positions. Here, we
              demonstrate increased fMRI activation in the left posterior
              parietal cortex when human participants adopted a crossed hands
              posture with their eyes closed. Furthermore, by assessing tactile
              temporal order judgments (TOJs) in the same individuals, we
              observed a positive association between activity in this area and
              the degree of reversal in TOJs resulting from crossing arms. The
              strongest positive association was observed in the left
              intraparietal sulcus. This result implies that the left posterior
              parietal cortex may be critically involved in monitoring limb
              position and in spatio-temporal binding when serial events are
              delivered to the limbs.",

              applied EEG source reconstruction via time-frequency linear
              constrained minimum variance beamforming to help elucidate the
              neural mechanisms involved in spatial conflict processing. Human
              subjects performed a Simon task, in which conflict was induced by
              incongruence between spatial location and response hand. We found
              an early (∼200 ms post-stimulus) conflict modulation in
              stimulus-contralateral parietal gamma (30-50 Hz), followed by a
              later alpha-band (8-12 Hz) conflict modulation, suggesting an
              early detection of spatial conflict and inhibition of spatial
              location processing. Inter-regional connectivity analyses
              assessed via cross-frequency coupling of theta (4-8 Hz), alpha,
              and gamma power revealed conflict-induced shifts in cortical
              network interactions: Congruent trials (relative to incongruent
              trials) had stronger coupling between frontal theta and
              stimulus-contrahemifield parietal alpha/gamma power, whereas
              incongruent trials had increased theta coupling between medial
              frontal and lateral frontal regions. These findings shed new

              models based on positive correlation values between the recorded
              and the reconstructed trajectories. This paper describes the
              mathematical properties of the linear model and the correlation
              evaluation metric that may lead to a misinterpretation of the
              results of this type of decoders. Firstly, the use of a linear
              regression model to adjust the two temporal signals (EEG and
              velocity profiles) implies that the relevant component of the
              signal used for decoding (EEG) has to be in the same frequency
              range as the signal to be decoded (velocity profiles). Secondly,
              the use of a correlation to evaluate the fitting of two
              trajectories could lead to overly-optimistic results as this
              metric is invariant to scale. Also, the correlation has a
              non-linear nature that leads to higher values for
              sinus/cosinus-like signals at low frequencies. Analysis of these
              properties on the reconstruction results was carried out through
              an experiment performed in line with previous studies, where
              healthy participants executed predefined reaching movements of
              the hand in 3D space. While the correlations of limb velocity
              profiles reconstructed from low-frequency EEG were comparable to
              studies in this domain, a systematic statistical analysis
              revealed that these results were not above the chance level. The
              empirical chance level was estimated using random assignments of
              recorded velocity profiles and EEG signals, as well as
              combinations of randomly generated synthetic EEG with recorded
              velocity profiles and recorded EEG with randomly generated
              synthetic velocity profiles. The analysis shows that the positive
              correlation results in this experiment cannot be used as an
              indicator of successful trajectory reconstruction based on a
              neural correlate. Several directions are herein discussed to
              address the misinterpretation of results as well as the
              implications on previous invasive and non-invasive works.",

  author    = "Kirchner, Elsa Andrea and Tabie, Marc and Seeland, Anett",
  abstract  = "Assistive devices, like exoskeletons or orthoses, often make use
               of physiological data that allow the detection or prediction of
               movement onset. Movement onset can be detected at the executing
               site, the skeletal muscles, as by means of electromyography.
               Movement intention can be detected by the analysis of brain
               activity, recorded by, e.g., electroencephalography, or in the
               behavior of the subject by, e.g., eye movement analysis. These
               different approaches can be used depending on the kind of
               neuromuscular disorder, state of therapy or assistive device. In
               this work we conducted experiments with healthy subjects while
               performing self-initiated and self-paced arm movements. While
               other studies showed that multimodal signal analysis can improve
               the performance of predictions, we show that a sensible
               combination of electroencephalographic and electromyographic
               data can potentially improve the adaptability of assistive
               technical devices with respect to the individual demands of,
               e.g., early and late stages in rehabilitation therapy. In
               earlier stages for patients with weak muscle or motor related
               brain activity it is important to achieve high positive
               detection rates to support self-initiated movements. To detect
               most movement intentions from electroencephalographic or
               electromyographic data motivates a patient and can enhance
               her/his progress in rehabilitation. In a later stage for
               patients with stronger muscle or brain activity, reliable
               movement prediction is more important to encourage patients to
               behave more accurately and to invest more effort in the task.
               Further, the false detection rate needs to be reduced. We
               propose that both types of physiological data can be used in an
               and combination, where both signals must be detected to drive a
               movement. By this approach the behavior of the patient during
               later therapy can be controlled better and false positive
               detections, which can be very annoying for patients who are
               further advanced in rehabilitation, can be avoided.",

              described for specific functions, with or without predominance of
              one specific frequency-band. In a simultaneous fMRI-EEG study at
              3 T we studied the relationship between the default mode network
              (DMN) and the power of EEG frequency bands. As a methodological
              approach, we applied Multivariate Exploratory Linear Optimized
              Decomposition into Independent Components (MELODIC) and dual
              regression analysis for fMRI resting state data. EEG power for
              the alpha, beta, delta and theta-bands were extracted from the
              structures forming the DMN in a region-of-interest approach by
              applying Low Resolution Electromagnetic Tomography (LORETA). A
              strong link between the spontaneous BOLD response of the left
              parahippocampal gyrus and the delta-band extracted from the
              anterior cingulate cortex was found. A positive correlation
              between the beta-1 frequency power extracted from the posterior
              cingulate cortex (PCC) and the spontaneous BOLD response of the
              right supplementary motor cortex was also established. The beta-2
              frequency power extracted from the PCC and the precuneus showed a
              positive correlation with the BOLD response of the right frontal

              highly significant correlation found between the delta power
              within the DMN and the parahippocampal gyrus is in line with the
              association of delta frequencies with memory processes. We
              assumed ``ongoing activity'' during ``resting state'' in bringing
              events from the past to the mind, in which the parahippocampal
              gyrus is a relevant structure. Our data demonstrate that
              spontaneous BOLD fluctuations within the DMN are associated with
              different EEG-bands and strengthen the conclusion that this
              network is characterized by a specific electrophysiological

              investigated. The goal of this study is to investigate the neural
              network related to SA. METHODS: SA of hand movements was
              modulated with virtual reality. We examined the cortical network
              relating to SA modulation with electroencephalography (EEG) power
              spectrum and phase coherence of alpha, beta, and gamma frequency
              bands in 16 right-handed, healthy volunteers. RESULTS: In the
              alpha band, significant relative power changes and phase
              coherence of alpha band were associated with SA modulation. The
              relative power decrease over the central, bilateral parietal, and
              right temporal regions (C4, Pz, P3, P4, T6) became larger as
              participants more effectively controlled the virtual hand
              movements. The phase coherence of the alpha band within frontal
              areas (F7-FP2, F7-Fz) was directly related to changes in SA. The
              functional connectivity was lower as the participants felt that
              they could control their virtual hand. In the other frequency
              bands, significant phase coherences were observed in the frontal
              (or central) to parietal, temporal, and occipital regions during
              SA modulation (Fz-O1, F3-O1, Cz-O1, C3-T4L in beta band; FP1-T6,
              FP1-O2, F7-T4L, F8-Cz in gamma band). CONCLUSIONS: Our study
              suggests that alpha band activity may be the main neural
              oscillation of SA, which suggests that the neural network within
              the anterior frontal area may be important in the generation of
              SA.",

              in everyday life, yet its neural underpinnings remain not fully
              understood. In this electroencephalography (EEG) study, we used
              single-trial classification to perform a Representational
              Similarity Analysis (RSA) of categorical representation of
              objects in human visual cortex. Brain responses were recorded
              while participants viewed a set of 72 photographs of objects with
              a planned category structure. The Representational Dissimilarity
              Matrix (RDM) used for RSA was derived from confusions of a linear
              classifier operating on single EEG trials. In contrast to past
              studies, which used pairwise correlation or classification to
              derive the RDM, we used confusion matrices from multi-class
              classifications, which provided novel self-similarity measures
              that were used to derive the overall size of the representational
              space. We additionally performed classifications on subsets of
              the brain response in order to identify spatial and temporal EEG
              components that best discriminated object categories and
              exemplars. Results from category-level classifications revealed
              that brain responses to images of human faces formed the most
              distinct category, while responses to images from the two
              inanimate categories formed a single category cluster.
              Exemplar-level classifications produced a broadly similar
              category structure, as well as sub-clusters corresponding to
              natural language categories. Spatiotemporal components of the
              brain response that differentiated exemplars within a category
              were found to differ from those implicated in differentiating
              between categories. Our results show that a classification
              approach can be successfully applied to single-trial
              scalp-recorded EEG to recover fine-grained object category
              structure, as well as to identify interpretable spatiotemporal
              components underlying object processing. Finally, object category
              can be decoded from purely temporal information recorded at
              single electrodes.",

              taxa and can drive behaviors, including foraging behavior. To
              explore the conditions under which memory provides an advantage,
              we present a continuous-space, continuous-time model of animal
              movement that incorporates learning and memory. Using simulation
              models, we evaluate the benefit memory provides across several
              types of landscapes with variable-quality resources and compare
              the memory model within a nested hierarchy of simpler models

              almost always leads to improved foraging success, but that this
              effect is most marked in landscapes containing sparse, contiguous
              patches of high-value resources that regenerate relatively fast
              and are located in an otherwise devoid landscape. In these cases,
              there is a large payoff for finding a resource patch, due to

              cues that underlie the perception of more complex phenomena such

              detailed view on the neural representation of onset structure is
              hard to obtain, since, typically, stimulus-related EEG signatures
              are derived by averaging a high number of identical stimulus
              presentations. Here, we propose a novel multivariate
              regression-based method extracting onset-related brain responses
              from the ongoing EEG. We analyse EEG recordings of nine subjects
              who passively listened to stimuli from various sound categories
              encompassing simple tone sequences, full-length romantic piano
              pieces and natural (non-music) soundscapes. The regression
              approach reduces the 61-channel EEG to one time course optimally
              reflecting note onsets. The neural signatures derived by this
              procedure indeed resemble canonical onset-related ERPs, such as
              the N1-P2 complex. This EEG projection was then utilized to
              determine the Cortico-Acoustic Correlation (CACor), a measure of
              synchronization between EEG signal and stimulus. We demonstrate
              that a significant CACor (i) can be detected in an individual
              listener's EEG of a single presentation of a full-length complex
              naturalistic music stimulus, and (ii) it co-varies with the
              stimuli's average magnitudes of sharpness, spectral centroid, and
              rhythmic complexity. In particular, the subset of stimuli
              eliciting a strong CACor also produces strongly coordinated
              tension ratings obtained from an independent listener group in a
              separate behavioral experiment. Thus musical features that lead

              by changes in psychophysiology and neural activity. In three fMRI
              experiments we systematically studied the impact of delayed
              feedback on brain activity while subjects performed an auditory
              categorization task. In the first fMRI experiment, we analyzed
              the effects of rare and thus unexpected delays of different delay
              duration on brain activity. In the second experiment, we
              investigated if users can adapt to frequent delays. Therefore,
              delays were presented as often as immediate feedback. In a third
              experiment, the influence of interaction outage was analyzed by
              measuring the effect of infrequent omissions of feedback on brain
              activity. The results show that unexpected delays in feedback

              the course of an interaction and trigger an orienting response
              that in turn activates brain regions of action control. If delays
              occur frequently, users can adapt, delays become expectable, and
              the brain activity in the observed network diminishes over the
              course of the interaction. However, introducing rare omissions of
              expected feedback reduces the system's trustworthiness which
              leads to an increase in brain activity not only in response to

              feedback, however, depended on object characteristics and task.
              Sensory feedback increased subject confidence and was directly
              correlated with accuracy. Subjects applied less pressure to the
              objects when they had tactile pressure feedback. Artificial
              somatosensory feedback improves object recognition and the
              relative importance of tactile versus proprioceptive feedback
              depends on the test set. We believe this test battery provides an
              effective means to assess the impact of sensory restoration and
              the relative contribution of different forms of feedback (tactile
              vs. kinesthetic) within the neurorehabilitation field.",

              probability of event onset as time elapses. This effect is termed
              the hazard rate of events. We tested how the neural encoding of
              hazard rate changes by providing human participants with prior
              information on temporal event probability. We recorded behavioral
              and electroencephalographic (EEG) data while participants
              listened to continuously repeating five-tone sequences, composed
              of four standard tones followed by a non-target deviant tone,
              delivered at slow (1.6 Hz) or fast (4 Hz) rates. The task was to
              detect a rare target tone, which equiprobably appeared at either
              position two, three or four of the repeating sequence. In this
              design, potential target position acts as a proxy for elapsed
              time. For participants uninformed about the target's
              distribution, elapsed time to uncertain target onset increased
              response speed, displaying a significant hazard rate effect at
              both slow and fast stimulus rates. However, only in fast
              sequences did prior information about the target's temporal
              distribution interact with elapsed time, suppressing the hazard
              rate. Importantly, in the fast, uninformed condition pre-stimulus
              power synchronization in the beta band (Beta 1, 15-19 Hz)
              predicted the hazard rate of response times. Prior information
              suppressed pre-stimulus power synchronization in the same band,
              while still significantly predicting response times. We conclude
              that Beta 1 power does not simply encode the hazard rate,

              metadata for downstream analysis, including information about the
              spatial origin of tissue. The Registration User Interface (RUI)
              was developed to allow stakeholders in the Human Biomolecular
              Atlas Program (HuBMAP) to register tissue blocks-i.e., to record
              the size, position, and orientation of human tissue data with
              regard to reference organs. The RUI has been used by tissue
              mapping centers across the HuBMAP consortium to register a total
              of 45 kidney, spleen, and colon tissue blocks, with planned
              support for 17 organs in the near future. In this paper, we
              compare three setups for registering one 3D tissue block object
              to another 3D reference organ (target) object. The first setup is
              a 2D Desktop implementation featuring a traditional screen,

              virtual reality (VR) versions of the RUI: VR Tabletop, where
              users sit at a physical desk which is replicated in virtual
              space; VR Standup, where users stand upright while performing
              their tasks. All three setups were implemented using the Unity
              game engine. We then ran a user study for these three setups
              involving 42 human subjects completing 14 increasingly difficult
              and then 30 identical tasks in sequence and reporting position
              accuracy, rotation accuracy, completion time, and satisfaction.
              All study materials were made available in support of future
              study replication, alongside videos documenting our setups. We
              found that while VR Tabletop and VR Standup users are about three
              times as fast and about a third more accurate in terms of
              rotation than 2D Desktop users (for the sequence of 30 identical
              tasks), there are no significant differences between the three
              setups for position accuracy when normalized by the height of the
              virtual kidney across setups. When extrapolating from the 2D
              Desktop setup with a 113-mm-tall kidney, the absolute performance

              in the series of 30 identical tasks) confirm that the 2D Desktop
              interface is well-suited for allowing users in HuBMAP to register
              tissue blocks at a speed and accuracy that meets the needs of
              experts performing tissue dissection. In addition, the 2D Desktop
              setup is cheaper, easier to learn, and more practical for

              30 trials. Blocks were divided into two experimental tactile
              feedback paradigms: tactile and non-tactile. Trials consisted of
              3 sequential phases: pre-grasping size perception, grasping, and
              post-grasping size perception. During pre- and post-phases,
              participants executed a saccade towards a horizontal bar and
              performed a manual size estimation of the bar size. During
              grasping phase, participants were asked to execute a saccade
              towards the bar and to make a grasping action towards the screen.
              While grasping, 3 horizontal size perturbation conditions were
              applied: non-perturbation, shortening, and lengthening. 30\% of
              the trials presented perturbation, meaning a symmetrically

              size estimation was significantly reduced in lengthening (p =
              0.002) and non-perturbation (p<0.001), whereas shortening did not
              induce significant adjustments (p = 0.86). After grasping,
              saccade amplitude became significantly longer in shortening
              (p<0.001) and significantly shorter in lengthening (p<0.001).
              Non-perturbation condition did not display adjustments (p =
              0.95). Tactile feedback did not generate changes in the collected
              perceptual responses, but horizontal size perturbations did so,

              to error-based learning in which continuous visual feedback of

              error-based learning with terminal visual feedback of the

              task in which participants moved a cursor to a single target
              while the gain between hand and cursor movement displacement was
              gradually altered. Different groups received either continuous
              error feedback (EC), terminal error feedback (ET), or binary
              reinforcement feedback (success/fail) at the end of the movement
              (R). Following adaptation we tested generalization to targets

              suggest that terminal error feedback leads to a more robust form
              of learning than continuous error feedback. In addition our
              findings are consistent with the view that error-based learning

              decisions have often to be made within a very short period of
              time and with limited information. This can result in decreased
              accuracy and efficiency. In this paper, we explore the
              possibility of increasing speed and accuracy of users engaged in
              the discrimination of realistic targets presented for a very
              short time, in the presence of unimodal or bimodal cues. More
              specifically, we present results from an experiment where users
              were asked to discriminate between targets rapidly appearing in
              an indoor environment. Unimodal (auditory) or bimodal
              (audio-visual) cues could shortly precede the target stimulus,

              spoken cues can be effective in boosting performance (accuracy,

              bimodal form. However, we also found that cue timing plays a
              critical role and, if the cue-stimulus interval is too short,
              cues may offer no advantage. In a post-hoc analysis of our data,
              we also show that congruency between the response location and
              both the target location and the cues, can interfere with the
              speed and accuracy in the task. These effects should be taken in

               spielt eine wichtige Rolle in klinischen Untersuchungen und
               steht dar{\"u}ber hinaus mit fast allen Aspekten der Kognition
               in Beziehung. Trotz der zentralen Rolle dieser Hirnprozesse,
               weisen viele g{\"a}ngige Analysemethoden Schw{\"a}chen auf,
               welche bisher weithin {\"u}bersehen wurden. An dieser Stelle
               setzt die vorliegende Dissertation an und tr{\"a}gt durch
               folgende Beitr{\"a}ge zum Fortschritt des Forschungsfeldes bei.
               Zun{\"a}chst werden die g{\"a}ngigen Analysemethoden sowohl
               durch analytische {\"U}berlegungen als auch durch numerische
               Simulationen gr{\"u}ndlich auf zwei wichtige Aspekte hin
               untersucht. Diese Aspekte sind die Genauigkeit und die
               Interpretierbarkeit der von den Methoden gelieferten Ergebnisse.
               Nur Methoden die mit Hinblick auf beide Aspekten {\"u}berzeugen,
               k{\"o}nnen von maximalen Nutzen f{\"u}r die Erforschung des
               Gehirns sein. Basierend auf den Ergebnissen dieser Untersuchung
               wird eine neue Methode vorgestellt, welche die vorher
               identifizierten Schw{\"a}chen {\"u}berwindet. Ihr Name ist
               Source Power Co-modulation (SPoC) Analyse. Basierend auf den
               {\"U}berlegungen die zur SPoC Analyse gef{\"u}hrt haben, werden
               zwei multimodale Erweiterungen vorgestellt: die multimodal
               Source Power Co-modulation (mSPoC) Analyse und die canonical
               Source Power Co-modulation (cSPoC) Analyse. Konkrete
               Anwendungsbeispiele die f{\"u}r mSPoC vorgestellt und diskutiert
               werden sind die Fusion von (i) Elektroenzophalografie (EEG) und
               funktioneller Nah-infrarot Spektroskopie (fNIRS) sowie (ii) EEG
               und funktioneller Magnetresonanztomografie (fMRT). cSPoC wurde
               speziell f{\"u}r die Fusion von mehreren amplitudenmodulierten
               oszillatorischen Datens{\"a}tzen entwickelt. Die
               N{\"u}tzlichkeit von cSPoC wird anhand von insgesamt drei
               Analyse-/Fusionsszenarien gezeigt: (i) die Fusion der Daten von
               mehreren Versuchspersonen, (ii) die Fusion verschiedener
               oszillatorischer Prozesse innerhalb von Versuchspersonen und
               (iii) die Fusion von simultan gemessenen EEG und
               Magnetenzephalographie (MEG) Daten. Alle in dieser Dissertation
               vorgestellten Analysemethoden basieren auf einem weitl{\"a}ufig
               akzeptierten linearen generativen Modell f{\"u}r das EEG und
               MEG. Der starke Bezug auf dieses Modell bildet die theoretisch
               fundierte Grundlage der Methoden. Die praktische Relevanz der
               Methoden spiegelt sich wider in der erfolgreichen Extraktion von
               physiologisch plausiblen Hirnaktivit{\"a}tsmustern aus einer
               Vielzahl von Beispieldaten. Dadurch stellen die entwickelten
               Analysemethoden eine attraktive Alternative zu vielen oft eher

  author   = "Scharinger, Christian",
  abstract = "During the last decade the combined recording of eye-tracking
              data and electroencephalographic (EEG) data has led to the
              methodology of fixation-related potentials analysis (FRP). This
              methodology has been increasingly and successfully used to study
              EEG correlates in the time domain (i.e., event-related
              potentials, ERPs) of cognitive processing in free viewing
              situations like text reading or natural scene perception.
              Basically, fixation-onset serves as time-locking event for
              epoching and analysing the EEG data. Here, we propose a
              methodology of fixation-related frequency band power analysis
              (FRBP) to study cognitive load and affective variations in
              learners during free viewing situations of multimedia learning
              materials (i.e., combinations of textual and pictorial elements).
              The EEG alpha frequency band power at parietal electrodes may
              serve as a valid measure of cognitive load, whereas the frontal
              alpha asymmetry may serve as a measure of affective variations.
              We will briefly introduce and motivate the measures and the
              methodology, and discuss methodological challenges. The
              methodology is frontline for learning research, first, as to date
              the EEG has been seldom used to study design effects of
              multimedia learning materials and second, as fixation-related EEG
              data analysis has rarely been done focussing on the frequency
              domain (i.e., FRBP). Despite methodological challenges still to
              be solved, FRBP may provide a more in-depth picture of cognitive
              processing during multimedia learning compared to eye-tracking
              data or EEG data in isolation and thus may help clarifying
              effects of multimedia design decisions.",

  author   = "Miller, Christopher A and Parasuraman, Raja",
  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: To develop a method enabling human-like, flexible
              supervisory control via delegation to automation. BACKGROUND:
              Real-time supervisory relationships with automation are rarely as
              flexible as human task delegation to other humans. Flexibility in
              human-adaptable automation can provide important benefits,
              including improved situation awareness, more accurate automation
              usage, more balanced mental workload, increased user acceptance,
              and improved overall performance. METHOD: We review problems with
              static and adaptive (as opposed to ``adaptable'') automation;
              contrast these approaches with human-human task delegation, which
              can mitigate many of the problems; and revise the concept of a
              ``level of automation'' as a pattern of task-based roles and
              authorizations. We argue that delegation requires a shared
              hierarchical task model between supervisor and subordinates, used
              to delegate tasks at various levels, and offer instruction on
              performing them. A prototype implementation called Playbook is
              described. RESULTS: On the basis of these analyses, we propose
              methods for supporting human-machine delegation interactions that
              parallel human-human delegation in important respects. We develop
              an architecture for machine-based delegation systems based on the
              metaphor of a sports team's ``playbook.'' Finally, we describe a
              prototype implementation of this architecture, with an
              accompanying user interface and usage scenario, for mission
              planning for uninhabited air vehicles. CONCLUSION: Delegation
              offers a viable method for flexible, multilevel human-automation
              interaction to enhance system performance while maintaining user
              workload at a manageable level. APPLICATION: Most applications of
              adaptive automation (aviation, air traffic control, robotics,
              process control, etc.) are potential avenues for the adaptable,
              delegation approach we advocate. We present an extended example

              and in the next movement by adjusting feedforward motor commands
              (offline correction or motor adaptation). Although recent studies
              have revealed a close relationship between feedback and
              feedforward controls, the nature of this relationship is not yet
              fully understood. Here, we show that both implicit online and
              offline movement corrections utilize the same visuomotor map for
              feedforward movement control that transforms the spatial location

              artificially distorted the visuomotor map by applying opposite

              multisensory grasping",
  author   = "Camponogara, Ivan and Volcic, Robert",
  abstract = "Human multisensory grasping movements (i.e., seeing and feeling a
              handheld object while grasping it with the contralateral hand)
              are superior to movements guided by each separate modality. This
              multisensory advantage might be driven by the integration of
              vision with either the haptic position only or with both position
              and size cues. To contrast these two hypotheses, we manipulated
              visual uncertainty (central vs. peripheral vision) and the
              availability of haptic cues during multisensory grasping. We
              showed a multisensory benefit irrespective of the degree of
              visual uncertainty suggesting that the integration process
              involved in multisensory grasping can be flexibly modulated by
              the contribution of each modality. Increasing visual uncertainty
              revealed the role of the distinct haptic cues. The haptic
              position cue was sufficient to promote multisensory benefits
              evidenced by faster actions with smaller grip apertures, whereas
              the haptic size was fundamental in fine-tuning the grip aperture
              scaling. These results support the hypothesis that, in
              multisensory grasping, vision is integrated with all haptic cues,
              with the haptic position cue playing the key part. Our findings
              highlight the important role of non-visual sensory inputs in
              sensorimotor control and hint at the potential contributions of
              the haptic modality in developing and maintaining visuomotor
              functions.Significance statementThe longstanding view that vision
              is considered the primary sense we rely on to guide grasping
              movements relegates the equally important haptic inputs, such as
              touch and proprioception, to a secondary role. Here we show that
              by increasing visual uncertainty during visuo-haptic grasping,
              the central nervous system exploits distinct haptic inputs about
              the object position and size to optimize grasping performance.
              Specifically, we demonstrate that haptic inputs about the object
              position are fundamental to support vision in enhancing grasping
              performance, whereas haptic size inputs can further refine hand
              shaping. Our results provide strong evidence that non-visual
              inputs serve an important, previously under-appreciated,
              functional role in grasping.",

  abstract = "Among the rhythms of the brain, oscillations in the beta
              frequency range (∼13-30 Hz) have been considered the most
              enigmatic. Traditionally associated with sensorimotor functions,
              beta oscillations have recently become more broadly implicated in
              top-down processing, long-range communication, and preservation
              of the current brain state. Here, we extend and refine these
              views based on accumulating new findings of content-specific
              beta-synchronization during endogenous information processing in
              working memory (WM) and decision making. We characterize such
              content-specific beta activity as short-lived, flexible network
              dynamics supporting the endogenous (re)activation of cortical
              representations. Specifically, we suggest that beta-mediated
              ensemble formation within and between cortical areas may awake,
              rather than merely preserve, an endogenous cognitive set in the
              service of current task demands. This proposal accommodates key
              aspects of content-specific beta modulations in monkeys and
              humans, integrates with timely computational models, and outlines
              a functional role for beta that fits its transient temporal

              activity: spatial and associative memory processes. During such
              processes, fMRI studies consistently demonstrate MTL activity,
              while electrophysiological studies have emphasized the important

              separately, while human participants used the spatial method of
              loci or the pegword method, a similarly associative but

              macroscopic scales and with large injected currents, previous
              studies have found various grades of frequency dependence of
              cortical tissue, ranging from negligible to strong, within the
              frequency band typically considered relevant for neuroscience
              (less than a few thousand hertz). Here, we performed a detailed
              investigation of the frequency dependence of the conductivity

              subthreshold stochastic fluctuations in neural activity that can
              be modeled as a process of accumulation to bound. One element of
              accumulator models that has been largely overlooked in the
              literature is the stochastic term, which is traditionally modeled
              as Gaussian white noise. While there may be practical reasons for
              this choice, we have long known that noise in neural systems is
              not white - it is long-term correlated with spectral density of
              the form 1/f$\beta$(with roughly 1 < $\beta$ < 3) across a broad
              range of spatial scales. I explored the behavior of a leaky
              stochastic accumulator when the noise over which it accumulates

              which navigators track distances, directions, and locations in

              landmark-based navigation have been examined, gray matter volume
              related to path integration ability has not yet been tested.
              Here, we examined individual differences in two path integration

              human participants who were fully ambulant. On each of 2 d,
              electroencephalography was synchronized with head and body
              movement in 13 subjects freely navigating an extended virtual
              environment containing numerous unique objects. $\vartheta$ phase

              autocorrelation analyses performed on an electrooculographic

              integration accumulate error unless reset by environmental
              sensory inputs that are necessarily egocentric (body-centered).
              Previous models of the head direction system avoided the
              necessary transformation between egocentric and allocentric
              reference frames by placing visual cues at infinity. Here we
              present a model of head direction coding that copes with
              exclusively proximal cues by making use of a conjunctive
              representation of head direction and location in retrosplenial
              cortex. Egocentric landmark bearing of proximal cues, which
              changes with location, is mapped onto this retrosplenial
              representation. The model avoids distortions due to parallax,
              which occur in simple models when a single proximal cue card is
              used, and can also accommodate multiple cues, suggesting how it
              can generalize to arbitrary sensory environments. It provides a
              functional account of the anatomical distribution of head
              direction cells along Papez' circuit, of place-by-direction
              coding in retrosplenial cortex, the anatomical connection from
              the anterior thalamic nuclei to retrosplenial cortex, and the
              involvement of retrosplenial cortex in navigation. In addition to
              parallax correction, the same mechanism allows for continuity of
              head direction coding between connected environments, and shows
              how a head direction representation can be stabilized by a single
              within arena cue. We also make predictions for drift during

              lesions on retrosplenial cells, and on head direction coding in
              differently shaped environments. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The
              activity of head direction cells signals the direction of an
              animal's head relative to landmarks in the world. Although driven
              by internal estimates of head movements, head direction cells
              must be kept aligned to the external world by sensory inputs,
              which arrive in the reference frame of the sensory receptors. We

              certainty, immersive virtual reality (IVR) may lead to a strong
              feeling of embodiment over an artificial body part seen from a
              first-person perspective (1PP). Although such feeling of
              ownership (FO) has been described in different situations, it is
              not yet understood how this phenomenon is generated at neural
              level. To track the real-time brain dynamics associated with FO,
              we delivered transcranial magnetic stimuli over the hand region
              in the primary motor cortex (M1) and simultaneously recorded
              electroencephalography (EEG) in 19 healthy volunteers (11 male/8

              electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings in people observing an
              embodied artificial limb. We found that just before the illusion
              started, there is a decrease of activity of the motor-hand area
              accompanied by an increase of connectivity with the parietal
              region ipsilateral to the stimulation that reflects the ratings
              of the embodiment illusion. Our results suggest that changes of

              critical role in the sense of body ownership (i.e., the
              multisensory perception of limbs and body parts as our own).
              However, little is known about how these areas implement the
              multisensory integration process at the computational level and
              whether activity predicts illusion elicitation in individual
              participants on a trial-by-trial basis. To address these
              questions, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging and a
              rubber hand illusion-detection task and fitted the registered
              neural responses to a Bayesian causal inference model of body

              delivered visual and tactile stimuli of a rubber hand (in view)
              and a (hidden) real hand. After the 12 s period, participants had
              to judge whether the rubber hand felt like their own. As
              hypothesized, activity in the premotor and posterior parietal
              cortices was related to illusion elicitation at the level of
              individual participants and trials. Importantly, activity in the

              retrosplenial cortex and the thalamus revealed significantly
              reduced BOLD responses when HD was repeated. Moreover, consistent
              with rodent findings, the signal did not continue to adapt over
              repetitions of the same HD. These results were supported by a
              whole-brain analysis showing additional repetition suppression in
              the precuneus. Together, our findings suggest that: (1)
              consistent with the rodent literature, the human thalamus may
              integrate visual and body-based, orientation cues; (2) global
              reference frame cues can be used to integrate HD across separate
              individual locales; and (3) immersive training procedures
              providing full body-based cues may help to elucidate the neural
              mechanisms supporting spatial navigation. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT:
              In rodents, head direction (HD) cells signal facing direction in
              the environment via increased firing when the animal assumes a
              certain orientation. Distinct brain regions, the retrosplenial
              cortex (RSC) and thalamus, code for visual and vestibular cues of
              orientation, respectively. Putative HD signals have been observed
              in human RSC but not the thalamus, potentially because body-based
              cues were not provided. Here, participants encoded HD in a novel
              virtual environment while wearing a head-mounted display to
              provide body-based cues for orientation. In subsequent fMRI
              scanning, we found evidence of an HD signal in RSC, thalamus, and
              precuneus. These findings harmonize rodent and human data, and
              suggest that immersive training procedures provide a viable way
              to examine the neural basis of navigation.",

              mechanisms for egocentric reach are relatively well described,

              unknown. Here, we used an event-related fMRI design to
              distinguish human brain areas involved in these two types of
              representation. Our paradigm consisted of three tasks with
              identical stimulus display but different instructions: egocentric
              reach (remember absolute target location), allocentric reach
              (remember target location relative to a visual landmark), and a
              nonspatial control, color report (report color of target). During
              the delay phase (when only target location was specified), the
              egocentric and allocentric tasks elicited widely overlapping
              regions of cortical activity (relative to the control), but with
              higher activation in parietofrontal cortex for egocentric task
              and higher activation in early visual cortex for allocentric
              tasks. In addition, egocentric directional selectivity (target

              and the inferior occipital gyrus, whereas allocentric directional
              selectivity (target relative to a visual landmark) was observed
              in the inferior temporal gyrus and inferior occipital gyrus.
              During the response phase (after movement direction had been
              specified either by reappearance of the visual landmark or a
              pro-/anti-reach instruction), the parietofrontal network resumed
              egocentric directional selectivity, showing higher activation for
              contralateral than ipsilateral reaches. These results show that
              allocentric and egocentric reach mechanisms use partially
              overlapping but different cortical substrates and that
              directional specification is different for target memory versus

              were used for source imaging based on individual anatomy. We
              separated sustained and movement phase-related EEG source
              amplitudes based on the actual finger movements recorded by a
              data glove. Sustained amplitude modulations in the contralateral
              hand area show decrease for $\alpha$ (10-12 Hz) and $\beta$
              (18-24 Hz), but increase for high $\gamma$ (60-80 Hz) frequencies
              during the entire movement period. Additionally, we found
              movement phase-related amplitudes, which resembled the flexion
              and extension sequence of the fingers. Especially for faster
              movement cadences, movement phase-related amplitudes included
              high $\beta$ (24-30 Hz) frequencies in prefrontal areas.
              Interestingly, the spectral profiles and source patterns of
              movement phase-related amplitudes differed from sustained
              activities, suggesting that they represent different

              signified by the sustained element, which statically modulate
              their synchrony levels during continuous movements. These
              networks may upregulate neuronal excitability in brain regions

              and integration. The separation of different large-scale

              suitable to relate cortical oscillations to actual movements.
              Investigating EEG sources during rhythmic finger movements, we

              distinction from the time sequence of the movements. These
              findings suggest that EEG source amplitudes reconstructed in a
              cortical patch are the superposition of these simultaneously
              present network activities. Separating these frequency-specific

              of human behavioral responses toward action-critical stimuli is
              the spatial correspondence between the stimulus and response
              locations. If both locations match, the time taken for response
              production is markedly reduced relative to when they mismatch, a
              phenomenon called the Simon effect. While there is a consensus
              that this stimulus-response (S-R) conflict is associated with
              brief (4-7 Hz) frontal midline theta (fm$\vartheta$) complexes

              whether there are multiple, simultaneously active theta generator
              areas in the medial frontal cortex that commonly give rise to
              conflict-related fm$\vartheta$ complexes; and if so, (2) whether

              time-frequency domain statistics on source-level activities to
              model fm$\vartheta$ sources. During target processing, our
              results revealed two independent fm$\vartheta$ generators
              simultaneously active in or near anterior cingulate cortex, only
              one of them reflecting the correspondence between current and
              previous S-R locations. However, this fm$\vartheta$ response is
              not exclusively linked to conflict but also to other,
              conflict-independent processes associated with response slowing.
              These results paint a detailed picture regarding the oscillatory
              correlates of conflict processing in Simon tasks, and challenge
              the prevalent notion that fm$\vartheta$ complexes induced by
              conflicting task information represent a unitary phenomenon

              STATEMENT Humans constantly monitor their environment for and
              adjust their cognitive control settings in response to conflicts,
              an ability that arguably paves the way for survival in
              ever-changing situations. Anterior cingulate-generated frontal
              midline theta (fm$\vartheta$) complexes have been hypothesized to
              play a role in this conflict-monitoring function. However, it
              remains a point of contention whether fm$\vartheta$ complexes
              govern conflict processing in a unitary, paradigm-nonspecific
              manner. Here, we identified two independent fm$\vartheta$
              oscillations triggered during a Simon-type task, only one of them

              processes and frontal midline theta (4-7 Hz) to evaluate
              maintenance processes. We tested for effects of task difficulty

              Correlated with alpha ERD during encoding were alpha power

              information for orientation and implementation of a planned route
              to the goal. Our results demonstrate that successful first and

              discriminate patterns of fMRI responses based on relative
              egocentric distance within trials from one distance domain (e.g.,
              photographs of objects relatively close to or far away from the
              viewer in spatial distance trials). Next, we tested whether the
              decision boundary generated from this training could distinguish
              brain responses according to relative egocentric distance within
              each of two separate distance domains (e.g., phrases referring to
              the immediate or more remote future within temporal distance
              trials; photographs of participants' friends or acquaintances
              within social distance trials). This procedure was repeated using
              all possible combinations of distance domains for training and
              testing the classifier. In all cases, above-chance decoding
              across distance domains was possible in the right inferior

              strategies. Here we use multivoxel pattern analysis of fMRI data
              to understand how landmarks are coded in the human brain.
              Subjects were scanned while viewing the interiors and exteriors
              of campus buildings. Despite their visual dissimilarity,
              interiors and exteriors corresponding to the same building
              elicited similar activity patterns in the parahippocampal place
              area (PPA), retrosplenial complex (RSC), and occipital place area
              (OPA), three regions known to respond strongly to scenes and
              buildings. Generalization across stimuli depended on knowing the
              correspondences among them in the PPA but not in the other two
              regions, suggesting that the PPA is the key region involved in
              learning the different perceptual instantiations of a landmark.
              In contrast, generalization depended on the ability to freely
              retrieve information from memory in RSC, and it did not depend on
              familiarity or cognitive task in OPA. Together, these results
              suggest a tripartite division of labor, whereby PPA codes
              landmark identity, RSC retrieves spatial or conceptual
              information associated with landmarks, and OPA processes visual
              features that are important for landmark recognition.
              SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: A central element of spatial navigation
              is the ability to recognize the landmarks that mark different
              places in the world. However, little is known about how the brain
              performs this function. Here we show that the parahippocampal
              place area (PPA), a region in human occipitotemporal cortex,
              exhibits key features of a landmark recognition mechanism.
              Specifically, the PPA treats different perceptual instantiations
              of the same landmark as representationally similar, but only when
              subjects have enough experience to know the correspondences among
              the stimuli. We also identify two other brain regions that
              exhibit landmark generalization, but with less sensitivity to
              familiarity. These results elucidate the brain networks involved
              in the learning and recognition of navigational landmarks.",

  abstract = "In this paper, we draw from recent theoretical work on active
              perception, which suggests that the brain makes use of an
              internal (i.e., generative) model to make inferences about the
              causes of sensations. This view treats visual sensations as
              consequent on action (i.e., saccades) and implies that visual
              percepts must be actively constructed via a sequence of eye
              movements. Oculomotor control calls on a distributed set of brain
              sources that includes the dorsal and ventral frontoparietal
              (attention) networks. We argue that connections from the frontal
              eye fields to ventral parietal sources represent the mapping from
              ``where'', fixation location to information derived from ``what''
              representations in the ventral visual stream. During scene
              construction, this mapping must be learned, putatively through
              changes in the effective connectivity of these synapses. Here, we
              test the hypothesis that the coupling between the dorsal frontal
              cortex and the right temporoparietal cortex is modulated during
              saccadic interrogation of a simple visual scene. Using dynamic
              causal modeling for magnetoencephalography with (male and female)
              human participants, we assess the evidence for changes in
              effective connectivity by comparing models that allow for this
              modulation with models that do not. We find strong evidence for
              modulation of connections between the two attention networks;
              namely, a disinhibition of the ventral network by its dorsal
              counterpart.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT This work draws from recent
              theoretical accounts of active vision and provides empirical
              evidence for changes in synaptic efficacy consistent with these

              combination with eye-tracking to assess the neural correlates of
              a form of short-term memory during a dot cancellation task. Using
              dynamic causal modeling to quantify changes in effective
              connectivity, we found evidence that the coupling between the
              dorsal and ventral attention networks changed during the saccadic
              interrogation of a simple visual scene. Intuitively, this is
              consistent with the idea that these neuronal connections may
              encode beliefs about ``what I would see if I looked there'', and
              that this mapping is optimized as new data are obtained with each

              in two large samples of adults (test sample n = 96, replication

              recruitment of inhibitory control accompanied by slower
              behavioral responses was related to changes in theta and

              implementation of a psychological phenomenon: inhibitory control
              is implemented by dynamic routing processes during which the
              target response is upregulated via theta-mediated effective

              neuroscientific studies have typically investigated spatial
              navigation on a horizontal 2D plane, leaving much unknown about
              how 3D spatial information is represented in the brain.
              Specifically, horizontal and vertical information may be encoded
              in the same or different neural structures with equal or unequal
              sensitivity. Here, we investigated these possibilities using fMRI
              while participants were passively moved within a 3D lattice
              structure as if riding a rollercoaster. Multivoxel pattern
              analysis was used to test for the existence of information
              relating to where and in which direction participants were
              heading in this virtual environment. Behaviorally, participants
              had similarly accurate memory for vertical and horizontal
              locations and the right anterior hippocampus (HC) expressed place
              information that was sensitive to changes along both horizontal
              and vertical axes. This is suggestive of isotropic 3D place
              encoding. In contrast, participants indicated their heading
              direction faster and more accurately when they were heading in a
              tilted-up or tilted-down direction. This direction information
              was expressed in the right retrosplenial cortex and posterior HC
              and was only sensitive to vertical pitch, which could reflect the
              importance of the vertical (gravity) axis as a reference frame.
              Overall, our findings extend previous knowledge of how we

              question is whether horizontal and vertical information is

              patterns while participants moved within a virtual 3D environment

              Specifically, we asked whether human posterior parietal cortex

              Although various electrophysiological studies in monkeys have

              to the planning of goal-directed motor behaviors. To this end, we
              compared delayed-response tasks with identical mnemonic and
              attentional demands but varying degrees of motor planning.
              Subjects memorized multiple target locations, and in a random
              subset of trials targets additionally instructed (1) desired
              goals or (2) undesired goals for upcoming finger reaches.
              Compared with the memory/attention-only conditions, both latter
              situations led to a specific increase of preparatory fMRI
              activity in posterior parietal and dorsal premotor cortex. Thus,
              posterior parietal cortex has prospective plans for upcoming
              behaviors while considering both types of targets relevant for
              action: those to be acquired and those to be avoided.",

              the processing of sensory information by the brain should be
              probabilistic: to start a movement or to alter it midflight, our
              brain should make predictions about the near future of sensory
              states and then continuously integrate the delayed sensory
              measures with predictions to form an estimate of the current

              increased uncertainty about the target, reach reaction times

              constrain associative learning, determining which stimuli can
              enter into association, as well as the functional form of that
              association. Bayesian learning theory provides one mechanism by
              which structural beliefs can be acquired from experience, but the
              neural basis of this mechanism is poorly understood. We studied
              this question with a combination of behavioral, computational,
              and neuroimaging techniques. Male and female human subjects
              learned to predict an outcome based on cue and context stimuli
              while being scanned using fMRI. Using a model-based analysis of
              the fMRI data, we show that structure learning signals are
              encoded in posterior parietal cortex, lateral prefrontal cortex,
              and the frontal pole. These structure learning signals are
              distinct from associative learning signals. Moreover,
              representational similarity analysis and information mapping
              revealed that the multivariate patterns of activity in posterior
              parietal cortex and anterior insula encode the full posterior
              distribution over causal structures. Variability in the encoding
              of the posterior across subjects predicted variability in their
              subsequent behavioral performance. These results provide evidence
              for a neural architecture in which structure learning guides the

              to infer the hidden structure behind causal relations between
              stimuli in the environment, allowing them to generalize this
              knowledge to stimuli they have never experienced before. A
              recently published computational model based on this idea
              provided a parsimonious account of a wide range of phenomena
              reported in the animal learning literature, suggesting a
              dedicated neural mechanism for learning this hidden structure.
              Here, we validate this model by measuring brain activity during a

              learning. We show that a distinct network of regions supports

  abstract = "UNLABELLED: Everyday locomotion and obstacle avoidance requires
              effective gait adaptation in response to sensory cues. Many
              studies have shown that efficient motor actions are associated
              with $\mu$ rhythm (8-13 Hz) and $\beta$ band (13-35 Hz) local
              field desynchronizations in sensorimotor and parietal cortex,
              whereas a number of cognitive task studies have reported higher
              behavioral accuracy to be associated with increases in $\beta$
              band power in prefrontal and sensory cortex. How these two
              distinct patterns of $\beta$ band oscillations interplay during
              gait adaptation, however, has not been established. Here we
              recorded 108 channel EEG activity from 18 participants (10 males,
              22-35 years old) attempting to walk on a treadmill in synchrony
              with a series of pacing cue tones, and quickly adapting their
              step rate and length to sudden shifts in pacing cue tempo.
              Independent component analysis parsed each participant's EEG data
              into maximally independent component (IC) source processes, which
              were then grouped across participants into distinct
              spatial/spectral clusters. Following cue tempo shifts, mean
              $\beta$ band power was suppressed for IC sources in central
              midline and parietal regions, whereas mean $\beta$ band power
              increased in IC sources in or near medial prefrontal and
              dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. In the right dorsolateral
              prefrontal cortex IC cluster, the $\beta$ band power increase was
              stronger during (more effortful) step shortening than during step
              lengthening. These results thus show that two distinct patterns
              of $\beta$ band activity modulation accompany gait adaptations:
              one likely serving movement initiation and execution; and the
              other, motor control and inhibition. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT:
              Understanding brain dynamics supporting gait adaptation is
              crucial for understanding motor deficits in walking, such as
              those associated with aging, stroke, and Parkinson's. Only a few
              electromagnetic brain imaging studies have examined neural
              correlates of human upright walking. Here, application of
              independent component analysis to EEG data recorded during
              treadmill walking allowed us to uncover two distinct $\beta$ band
              oscillatory cortical networks that are active during gait
              adaptation to shifts in the tempo of an auditory pacing cue:
              (8-13 Hz) $\mu$ rhythm and (13-35 Hz) $\beta$ band power
              decreases in central and parietal cortex and (14-20 Hz) $\beta$
              band power increases in frontal brain areas. These results
              provide a fuller framework for electrophysiological studies of
              cortical gait control and its disorders.",

              very simple motor responses (e.g., button press), errors concern
              inappropriate action-selection only. However, EEG activity in

              similarities in terms of time course, topography, and potential

              about how the brain accrues and holds these sensory signals to
              guide later actions. Previous work has suggested that neural
              activity in the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) of the monkey
              brain reflects the formation of perceptual decisions in a random
              dot direction-discrimination task in which monkeys communicate

              hypothesis that decision-related neural activity in LIP
              represents the time integral of the momentary motion
              ``evidence.'' By briefly perturbing the strength of the visual
              motion stimulus during the formation of perceptual decisions, we
              tested whether this LIP activity reflected a persistent,

              decision-related LIP responses, as well as behavioral choices and

              evidence suggests that these perceptual experiences can be used
              not only to acquire route knowledge but also to directly assemble
              map-like survey representations. Most studies of human navigation
              focus on the retrieval of previously learned environments, and
              the neural foundations of integrating sequential views into a
              coherent representation are not yet fully understood. We
              therefore used our recently introduced virtual-reality paradigm,
              which provides accuracy and reaction-time measurements precisely
              indicating the emergence of survey knowledge, and functional
              magnetic resonance imaging while participants repeatedly encoded
              a complex environment from a first-person ground-level
              perspective. Before the experiment, we gave specific instructions
              to induce survey learning, which, based on the clear evidence for
              emerging survey knowledge in the behavioral data from 11
              participants, proved successful. Neuroimaging data revealed
              increasing activation across sessions only in bilateral

              activation was most prominent during the initial learning phase

  abstract = "Brain function can be conceived as a hierarchy of generative
              models that optimizes predictions of sensory inputs and minimizes
              ``surprise.'' Each level of the hierarchy makes predictions of
              neural events at a lower level in the hierarchy, which returns a
              prediction error when these expectations are violated. We tested
              the generalization of this hypothesis to multiple sequential
              deviations, and we identified the most likely organization of the
              network that accommodates deviations in temporal structure of
              stimuli. Magnetoencephalography of healthy human participants
              during an auditory paradigm identified prediction error responses
              in bilateral primary auditory cortex, superior temporal gyrus,
              and lateral prefrontal cortex for deviation by frequency,
              intensity, location, duration, and silent gap. We examined the
              connectivity between cortical sources using a set of 21
              generative models that embedded alternate hypotheses of
              frontotemporal network dynamics. Bayesian model selection
              provided evidence for two new features of functional network
              organization. First, an expectancy signal provided input to the
              prefrontal cortex bilaterally, related to the temporal structure
              of stimuli. Second, there are functionally significant lateral
              connections between superior temporal and/or prefrontal cortex.
              The results support a predictive coding hypothesis but go beyond
              previous work in demonstrating the generalization to multiple
              concurrent stimulus dimensions and the evidence for a temporal
              expectancy input at the higher level of the frontotemporal
              hierarchy. We propose that this framework for studying the
              brain's response to unexpected events is not limited to simple
              sensory tasks but may also apply to the neurocognitive mechanisms
              of higher cognitive functions and their disorders.",

  abstract = "When we use a novel tool, the motor commands may not produce the
              expected outcome. In healthy individuals, with practice the brain
              learns to alter the motor commands. This change depends
              critically on the cerebellum as damage to this structure impairs
              adaptation. However, it is unclear precisely what the cerebellum
              contributes to the process of adaptation in human motor learning.
              Is the cerebellum crucial for learning to associate motor
              commands with novel sensory consequences, called forward model,
              or is the cerebellum important for learning to associate sensory
              goals with novel motor commands, called inverse model? Here, we
              compared performance of cerebellar patients and healthy controls
              in a reaching task with a gradual perturbation schedule. This
              schedule allowed both groups to adapt their motor commands.
              Following training, we measured two kinds of behavior: in one
              case, people were presented with reach targets near the direction
              in which they had trained. The resulting generalization patterns
              of patients and controls were similar, suggesting comparable
              inverse models. In the second case, participants reached without
              a target and reported the location of their hand. In controls,
              the pattern of change in reported hand location was consistent
              with simulation results of a forward model that had learned to
              associate motor commands with new sensory consequences. In
              patients, this change was significantly smaller. Therefore, in
              our sample of patients, we observed that while adaptation of
              motor commands can take place despite cerebellar damage,
              cerebellar integrity appears critical for learning to predict
              visual sensory consequences of motor commands.",

              reached for and grasped a bar and moved it to press a
              target-switch. Subjects almost exclusively fixated certain
              landmarks critical for the control of the task. Landmarks at
              which contact events took place were obligatory gaze targets.
              These included the grasp site on the bar, the target, and the
              support surface where the bar was returned after target contact.
              Any obstacle in the direct movement path and the tip of the bar
              were optional landmarks. Subjects never fixated the hand or the
              moving bar. Gaze and hand/bar movements were linked concerning
              landmarks, with gaze leading. The instant that gaze exited a
              given landmark coincided with a kinematic event at that landmark
              in a manner suggesting that subjects monitored critical kinematic
              events for phasic verification of task progress and subgoal
              completion. For both the obstacle and target, subjects directed
              saccades and fixations to sites that were offset from the

              obstacle appeared to specify a location around which the

              supports hand movement planning by marking key positions to which
              the fingertips or grasped object are subsequently directed. The
              salience of gaze targets arises from the functional sensorimotor
              requirements of the task. We further suggest that gaze control
              contributes to the development and maintenance of sensorimotor
              correlation matrices that support predictive motor control in

              part of one's own body and to maintain cognitive transparency in
              which the cognitive load is suppressed. Embodiment studies have
              been conducted with an expansion of bodily functions through a
              ``substitution'' and ``extension.'' However, there have been few
              studies on the ``addition'' of supernumerary body parts. In this
              study, we developed a supernumerary robotic limb system that
              operates in a virtual environment, and then evaluated whether the
              extra limb can be regarded as a part of one's own body using a
              questionnaire and whether the perception of peripersonal space
              change with a visuotactile crossmodal congruency task. We found

              on demographics and simulator sickness and postquestionnaires on
              simulator sickness and perceived restorativeness before and after
              exposure to virtual nature, respectively. During the VR exposure,
              brain activity was measured by electroencephalography as
              participants were asked to conduct a 2-tone passive auditory
              oddball task. RESULTS: The amplitude and latency of the MMN/P3a
              complex were compared between individuals reporting a highly
              restorative experience and those reporting a less restorative
              experience. Although viewing a virtual nature environment, the
              high restorative group (N=19) exhibited significantly reduced P3a
              amplitudes compared with the low restorative group (N=20;
              t38=2.57; P=.02; d=0.59). Particularly, a moderate but
              significant negative correlation was found between the
              self-reported restorativeness scores and the P3a amplitudes at
              the fronto-central region (r=-.38; P=.02). However, the latency
              of the MMN/P3a complex did not significantly differ between the 2
              groups (auditory mismatch negativity: t38=-1.47; P=.15 and P3a:
              t38=-0.31; P=.76). CONCLUSIONS: Considering individuals'
              restorative experience, the amplitude of the fronto-central
              MMN/P3a complex can potentially be employed as a distinct ERP
              component of interest in involuntary attention restoration during
              virtual nature experience in healthy young adults. The findings
              for the 360° virtual nature experience seem to be consistent with
              those of previous ERP studies on the effects of meditation
              practice. This study extends the findings of previous ART and ERP
              studies of real-world meditation, restoration, and mental fatigue
              management into the virtual world created by mobile phone-based
              VR glasses and 360° video content.",

  abstract = "Many studies have reported that bottom-up multisensory
              integration of visual, tactile, and proprioceptive information
              can distort our sense of body-ownership, producing rubber hand
              illusion (RHI). There is less evidence about when and how the
              body-ownership is distorted in the brain during RHI. To examine
              whether this illusion effect occurs preattentively at an early
              stage of processing, we monitored the visual mismatch negativity
              (vMMN) component (the index of automatic deviant detection) and
              N2 (the index for conflict monitoring). Participants first
              performed an RHI elicitation task in a synchronous or
              asynchronous setting and then finished a passive visual oddball
              task in which the deviant stimuli were unrelated to the explicit
              task. A significant interaction between Deviancy (deviant hand
              vs. standard hand) and Group (synchronous vs. asynchronous) was

              both vMMN and N2, while the synchronous group had such effect
              only in N2. The results indicate that after the elicitation of
              RHI bottom-up integration could be retrieved at the early stage
              of sensory processing before top-down processing, providing
              evidence for the priority of the bottom-up processes after the

               widespread availability of workstations having good graphics and
               computational capabilities. This book is a guide to using S-PLUS
               to perform statistical analyses and provides both an
               introduction to the use of S-PLUS and a course in modern
               statistical methods. S-PLUS is available for both Windows and
               UNIX workstations, and both versions are covered in depth. The
               aim of the book is to show how to use S-PLUS as a powerful and
               graphical data analysis system. Readers are assumed to have a
               basic grounding in statistics, and so the book in intended for
               would-be users of S-PLUS and both students and researchers using
               statistics. Throughout, the emphasis is on presenting practical
               problems and full analyses of real data sets. Many of the
               methods discussed are state-of-the-art approaches to topics such
               as linear, nonlinear, and smooth regression models, tree-based
               methods, multivariate analysis and pattern recognition, survival
               analysis, time series and spatial statistics. Throughout, modern
               techniques such as robust methods, non-parametric smoothing, and
               bootstrapping are used where appropriate. This third edition is
               intended for users of S-PLUS 4.5, 5.0, 2000 or later, although
               S-PLUS 3.3/4 are also considered. The major change from the
               second edition is coverage of the current versions of S-PLUS.
               The material has been extensively rewritten using new examples
               and the latest computationally intensive methods. The companion
               volume on S Programming will provide an in-depth guide for those
               writing software in the S language. The authors have written
               several software libraries that enhance S-PLUS; these and all
               the datasets used are available on the Internet in versions for
               Windows and UNIX. There are extensive on-line complements

              objects as experimental stimuli. Results suggest these stimuli
              are categorized based on abstract linguistic concepts.
              Concurrently, studies in the past 10 years have found differences
              in the processing of images as compared to real-world objects.
              One proposed explanation is that these results are due to
              differences in the affordances of images versus objects. Using a
              similarity judgement paradigm, we have explored the effect of
              affordances in a categorization task including words (object
              names), images, and objects. Consistent with previous research,
              we found significant differences in how participants made
              similarity judgements of images and objects. Moreover, we found
              that similarity judgments using object names were much more
              similar to the judgments of pictures than of objects. An
              exploratory cluster analysis opens the possibility of framing

              need for more ecologically valid categorization tasks, more
              conservative inferences when using images as stimuli in these
              tasks, and the need for further exploring the role of affordances

               reliable results, they are influenced by subjective factors

               foundation. The proposal is motivated by that framework's
               ability to address three general challenges to identifying the
               neural correlates of consciousness, and to satisfy two
               constraints common to many theories of consciousness.
               Implementing the search for neural correlates of consciousness
               through the lens of predictive processing delivers strong
               potential for predictive and explanatory value through detailed,

              immediately adjacent to and surrounding the body, the
              peripersonal space (PPS). However, human interactions
              increasingly occur with or within virtual environments, and hence
              novel approaches and metrics must be developed to index
              human--environment interactions in virtual reality (VR). Here, we
              present a multisensory task that measures the spatial extent of
              human PPS in real, virtual, and augmented realities. We validated
              it in a mixed reality (MR) ecosystem in which real environment
              and virtual objects are blended together in order to administer
              and control visual, auditory, and tactile stimuli in ecologically
              valid conditions. Within this mixed-reality environment,
              participants are asked to respond as fast as possible to tactile
              stimuli on their body, while task-irrelevant visual or
              audiovisual stimuli approach their body. Results demonstrate
              that, in analogy with observations derived from monkey
              electrophysiology and in real environmental surroundings, tactile
              detection is enhanced when visual or auditory stimuli are close
              to the body, and not when far from it. We then calculate the
              location where this multisensory facilitation occurs as a proxy
              of the boundary of PPS. We observe that mapping of PPS via
              audiovisual, as opposed to visual alone, looming stimuli results
              in sigmoidal fits---allowing for the bifurcation between near and
              far space---with greater goodness of fit. In sum, our approach is
              able to capture the boundaries of PPS on a spatial continuum, at
              the individual-subject level, and within a fully controlled and
              previously laboratory-validated setup, while maintaining the
              richness and ecological validity of real-life events. The task
              can therefore be applied to study the properties of PPS in humans
              and to index the features governing human--environment
              interactions in virtual or MR. We propose PPS as an ecologically
              valid and neurophysiologically established metric in the study of
              the impact of VR and related technologies on society and

              walking performance under Dual-task (DT) conditions. Little is
              known about the neural representation of DT performance while
              walking in this target group compared to healthy controls or
              younger adults. Therefore, utilizing the Mobile Brain/Body
              Imaging approach (MoBI), we aim at gaining deeper insights into
              the brain dynamics underlying the interaction of cognitive and
              motor processes during different DT conditions (visual and
              auditory) controlling for age and the potential performance
              decrements of older adults with hearing impairments. Methods: The
              cross-sectional study integrates a multifactorial mixed-measure
              design. Between-subject factors grouping the sample will be age
              (younger vs. older adults) and hearing impairment (mild vs. not
              hearing impaired). The within-subject factors will be the task
              complexity (single- vs. DT) and cognitive task modality (visual
              vs. auditory). Stimuli of the cognitive task will vary according
              to the stimulus modality (visual vs. auditory), presentation side
              (left vs. right), and presentation-response compatibility
              (ipsilateral vs. contralateral). Analyses of DT costs and
              underlying neuronal correlates focus either on gait or cognitive
              performance. Based on an a priori sample size calculation 96 (48
              healthy and 48 mildly hearing impaired) community-dwelling older
              adults (50-70 years) and 48 younger adults (20-30 years) will be
              recruited. Gait parameters of speed and rhythm will be captured.
              EEG activity will be recorded using 64 active electrodes.
              Discussion: The study evaluates cognitive-motor interference
              (CMI) in groups of young and older adults as well as older adults
              with hearing impairment. The underlying processes of the
              interaction between motor and cognitive tasks will be identified
              at a behavioral and neurophysiological level comparing an
              auditory or a visual secondary task. We assume that performance
              differences are linked to different cognitive-motor processes,
              i.e., stimulus input, resource allocation, and movement
              execution. Moreover, for the different DT conditions (auditory
              vs. visual) we assume performance decrements within the auditory
              condition, especially for older, hearing-impaired adults.
              Findings will provide evidence of general mechanisms of CMI (ST
              vs. DT walking) as well as task-specific effects in dual-task
              performance while over ground walking.",

              gender, video gaming experience, and self-estimates of spatial
              navigation abilities in a population of 300 subjects.
              Participants watched videos of virtual passages through a
              star-field with one turn in either the horizontal (yaw) or the
              vertical (pitch) axis. At the end of a passage they selected one
              out of four homing arrows to indicate the initial starting
              location. To solve the task, participants could employ two
              discrete strategies, navigating within either an egocentric or an
              allocentric reference frame. The majority of valid subjects
              (232/260) consistently used the same strategy in more than 75\%
              of all trials. With that approach 33.1\% of all participants were
              classified as Turners (using an egocentric reference frame on
              both axes) and 46.5\% as Non-turners (using an allocentric
              reference frame on both axes). 9.2\% of all participants
              consistently used an egocentric reference frame in the yaw plane

              Investigating the influence of gender on navigation strategies
              revealed that females predominantly used the Non-turner strategy
              while males used both the Turner and the Non-turner strategy with
              comparable probabilities. Other than expected, video gaming
              experience did not influence strategy use. Based on a strong
              quantitative basis with the sample size about an order of
              magnitude larger than in typical psychophysical studies these
              results demonstrate that most people reliably use one out of
              three possible navigation strategies (Turners, Non-turners,
              Switchers) for spatial updating and provides a sound estimate of

              related to moral and social judgments. In a virtual reality (VR)
              setting we performed an experiment investigating the progression
              from fast, automatic decisions towards more controlled decisions
              over multiple trials in the context of a sacrificing scenario. We
              repeatedly exposed participants to a modified ten-to-one version
              and to three one-to-one versions of the trolley dilemma in VR and
              varied avatar properties, such as their gender and ethnicity, and
              their orientation in space. We also investigated the influence of
              arousing music on decisions. Our experiment replicated the
              behavioral pattern observed in studies using text versions of the
              trolley dilemma, thereby validating the use of virtual
              environments in research on moral judgments. Additionally, we
              found a general tendency towards sacrificing male individuals
              which correlated with socially desirable responding. As indicated
              by differences in response times, the ten-to-one version of the
              trolley dilemma seems to be faster to decide than decisions
              requiring comparisons based on specific avatar properties as a
              result of differing moral content. Building upon research on
              music-based emotion induction, we used music to induce emotional
              arousal on a physiological level as measured by pupil diameter.
              We found a specific temporal signature displaying a peak in
              arousal around the moment of decision. This signature occurs
              independently of the overall arousal level. Furthermore, we found
              context-dependent gaze durations during sacrificing decisions,
              leading participants to look prolonged at their victim if they
              had to choose between avatars differing in gender. Our study
              confirmed that moral decisions can be explained within the
              framework of dual-process theories and shows that pupillometric

              using algorithms to make decisions in situations where harming
              humans is possible, probable, or even unavoidable, a self-driving
              car's ethical behavior comes pre-defined. Ad hoc decisions are
              made in milliseconds, but can be based on extensive research and
              debates. The same algorithms are also likely to be used in
              millions of cars at a time, increasing the impact of any inherent
              biases, and increasing the importance of getting it right.
              Previous research has shown that moral judgment and behavior are
              highly context-dependent, and comprehensive and nuanced models of
              the underlying cognitive processes are out of reach to date.
              Models of ethics for self-driving cars should thus aim to match
              human decisions made in the same context. We employed immersive
              virtual reality to assess ethical behavior in simulated road
              traffic scenarios, and used the collected data to train and
              evaluate a range of decision models. In the study, participants
              controlled a virtual car and had to choose which of two given
              obstacles they would sacrifice in order to spare the other. We
              randomly sampled obstacles from a variety of inanimate objects,

              based on one-dimensional value-of-life scales are suited to
              describe human ethical behavior in these situations. Furthermore,
              we examined the influence of severe time pressure on the

              in the decision patterns, thus providing an argument for

              while traversing an environment, these mammals tend to use
              different frames of reference and frequently switch between them.
              These frames represent allocentric, egocentric, or route-centric
              views of the environment. However, combinations of either of them
              are often deployed. Neurophysiological studies on rats have
              indicated that the hippocampus, the retrosplenial cortex, and the
              posterior parietal cortex contribute to the formation of these
              frames and mediate the transformation between those. In this
              paper, we construct a computational model of the posterior
              parietal cortex and the retrosplenial cortex for spatial
              navigation. We demonstrate how the transformation of reference
              frames could be realized in the brain and suggest how different
              brain areas might use these reference frames to form navigational
              strategies and predict under what conditions an animal might use
              a specific type of reference frame. Our simulated navigation
              experiments demonstrate that the model's results closely resemble
              behavioral findings in humans and rats. These results suggest
              that navigation strategies may depend on the animal's reliance in
              a particular reference frame and shows how low confidence in a
              reference frame can lead to fluid adaptation and deployment of
              alternative navigation strategies. Because of its flexibility,

              It begs the question of how humans react to and interact with
              robots in a coordinated manner and what the neural underpinnings
              of such behavior are. This exploratory study aims to understand
              the differences in human-human and human-robot interactions at a
              behavioral level and from a neurophysiological perspective. For
              this purpose, we adapted a collaborative dynamical paradigm from
              the literature. We asked 12 participants to hold two corners of a
              tablet while collaboratively guiding a ball around a circular
              track either with another participant or a robot. In irregular
              intervals, the ball was perturbed outward creating an artificial
              error in the behavior, which required corrective measures to
              return to the circular track again. Concurrently, we recorded
              electroencephalography (EEG). In the behavioral data, we found an
              increased velocity and positional error of the ball from the
              track in the human-human condition vs. human-robot condition. For
              the EEG data, we computed event-related potentials. We found a

              significant clusters at fronto-central electrodes. The amplitudes
              were stronger with a robot partner, suggesting a different neural
              processing. All in all, our exploratory study suggests that
              coordinating with robots affects action monitoring related
              processing. In the investigated paradigm, human participants
              treat errors during human-robot interaction differently from
              those made during interactions with other humans. These results

              Retrosplenial Cortex: A Computational Model",
  author   = "Page, Hector J I and Jeffery, Kate J",
  abstract = "Maintaining a sense of direction is fundamental to navigation,
              and is achieved in the brain by a network of head direction (HD)
              cells, which update their signal using stable environmental
              landmarks. How landmarks are detected and their stability
              determined is still unknown. Recently we reported a new class of
              cells (Jacob et al., 2017), the bidirectional cells, in a brain
              region called retrosplenial cortex (RSC) which relays
              environmental sensory information to the HD system. A subset of
              these cells, between-compartment (BC) cells, are directionally
              tuned (like ordinary HD cells) but follow environmental cues in
              preference to the global HD signal, resulting in opposing (i.e.,
              bidirectional) tuning curves in opposed environments. Another
              subset, within-compartment (WC) cells, unexpectedly expressed
              bidirectional tuning curves in each one of the opposed
              compartments. Both BC and WC cells lost directional tuning in an
              open field, unlike HD cells. Two questions arise from this
              discovery: (i) how do these cells acquire their unusual response
              properties, and (ii) what are they for? We propose that
              bidirectional cells reflect a two-way interaction between local
              direction, as indicated by the visual environment, and global
              direction as signaled by the HD system. We suggest that BC cells
              receive strong inputs from visual cues, while WC cells
              additionally receive modifiable inputs from HD cells which, due
              to Hebbian coactivation of visual inputs plus two opposing sets
              of HD inputs, acquire the ability to fire in both directions. A
              neural network model instantiating this hypothesis is presented,
              which indeed forms both BC and WC bidirectional cells with
              properties similar to those seen experimentally. We then
              demonstrate how tuning specificity degrades when WC/BC cells are
              exposed to multiple directionalities, replicating the observed
              loss of WC and BC directional tuning in the open field. We
              suggest that the function of these neurons is to assess the
              stability of environmental landmarks, thereby determining their
              utility as reference points by which to set the HD sense of
              direction. This role could extend to the ability of the HD system
              to prefer distal over proximal landmarks, and to correct for
              parallax errors.",

              movement. This work investigates the potential use of brain
              signals recorded non-invasively for detecting the time before a
              self-paced reaching movement is initiated which could contribute
              to the design of practical upper limb neuroprosthetics. In
              particular, we show the detection of self-paced reaching movement
              intention in single trials using the readiness potential, an
              electroencephalography (EEG) slow cortical potential (SCP)
              computed in a narrow frequency range (0.1-1 Hz). Our experiments
              with 12 human volunteers, two of them stroke subjects, yield high
              detection rates prior to the movement onset and low detection
              rates during the non-movement intention period. With the proposed
              approach, movement intention was detected around 500 ms before
              actual onset, which clearly matches previous literature on
              readiness potentials. Interestingly, the result obtained with one
              of the stroke subjects is coherent with those achieved in healthy
              subjects, with single-trial performance of up to 92\% for the

  abstract = "In order to understand the working brain as a network, it is
              essential to identify the mechanisms by which information is

              by inhibiting task-irrelevant regions, thus routing information
              to task-relevant regions. The functional inhibition is reflected
              in oscillatory activity in the alpha band (8-13 Hz). From a
              physiological perspective the alpha activity provides pulsed
              inhibition reducing the processing capabilities of a given area.
              Active processing in the engaged areas is reflected by neuronal
              synchronization in the gamma band (30-100 Hz) accompanied by an
              alpha band decrease. According to this framework the brain could
              be studied as a network by investigating cross-frequency
              interactions between gamma and alpha activity. Specifically the

               modalities on cortical processing. We developed a fully
               immersive virtual reality setup combined with high-density
               mobile electroencephalography (EEG). Participants traversed one
               leg of a triangle, turned on the spot, continued along the
               second leg, and finally indicated the location of their starting
               position. Vestibular and kinesthetic information was provided
               either in combination, as isolated sources of information, or
               not at all within a 2 $\times$ 2 full factorial intra-subjects
               design. EEG data were processed by clustering independent
               components, and time-frequency spectrograms were calculated. In
               parietal, occipital, and temporal clusters, we detected alpha
               suppression during the turning movement, which is associated
               with a heightened demand of visuo-attentional processing and
               closely resembles results reported in previous stationary
               studies. This decrease is present in all conditions and

               incongruent conditions, when different sensory modalities did

               movements. In this study we examined the impact of an
               interactive Virtual Environment (VE) feedback task on the EEG
               patterns during robot assisted walking. We compared walking in
               the VE modality to two control conditions: walking with a visual
               attention paradigm, in which visual stimuli were unrelated to
               the motor task; and walking with mirror feedback, in which
               participants observed their own movements. Eleven healthy
               participants were considered. Application of independent
               component analysis to the EEG revealed three independent
               component clusters in premotor and parietal areas showing
               increased activity during walking with the adaptive VE training
               paradigm compared to the control conditions. During the
               interactive VE walking task spectral power in frequency ranges
               8-12, 15-20, and 23-40 Hz was significantly (p $\leq$ 0.05)
               decreased. This power decrease is interpreted as a correlate of
               an active cortical area. Furthermore activity in the premotor
               cortex revealed gait cycle related modulations significantly
               different (p $\leq$ 0.05) from baseline in the frequency range
               23-40 Hz during walking. These modulations were significantly (p
               $\leq$ 0.05) reduced depending on gait cycle phases in the
               interactive VE walking task compared to the control conditions.
               We demonstrate that premotor and parietal areas show increased
               activity during walking with the adaptive VE training paradigm,
               when compared to walking with mirror- and movement unrelated
               feedback. Previous research has related a premotor-parietal
               network to motor planning and motor intention. We argue that
               movement related interactive feedback enhances motor planning
               and motor intention. We hypothesize that this might improve gait
               recovery during rehabilitation.",

              Prior research has often conceptualized this capacity in terms of
              a motoric matching of observed actions to an action in one's
              motor repertoire, but has ignored the role of object information.
              In this manuscript, we set out an alternative conception of
              intention understanding, which places the role of objects as
              central to our observation and comprehension of the actions of
              others. We outline the current understanding of the
              interconnectedness of action and object knowledge, demonstrating
              how both rely heavily on the other. We then propose a novel
              framework, the affordance-matching hypothesis, which incorporates
              these findings into a simple model of action understanding, in
              which object knowledge-what an object is for and how it is
              used-can inform and constrain both action interpretation and
              prediction. We will review recent empirical evidence that
              supports such an object-based view of action understanding and we

  abstract = "When humans walk in everyday life, they typically perform a range
              of cognitive tasks while they are on the move. Past studies
              examining performance changes in dual cognitive-motor tasks
              during walking have produced a variety of results. These
              discrepancies may be related to the type of cognitive task
              chosen, differences in the walking speeds studied, or lack of
              controlling for walking speed. The goal of this study was to
              determine how young, healthy subjects performed a spatial working
              memory task over a range of walking speeds. We used high-density
              electroencephalography to determine if electrocortical activity
              mirrored changes in cognitive performance across speeds. Subjects
              stood (0.0 m/s) and walked (0.4, 0.8, 1.2, and 1.6 m/s) with and
              without performing a Brooks spatial working memory task. We
              hypothesized that performance of the spatial working memory task
              and the associated electrocortical activity would decrease
              significantly with walking speed. Across speeds, the spatial
              working memory task caused subjects to step more widely compared
              with walking without the task. This is typically a sign that
              humans are adapting their gait dynamics to increase gait
              stability. Several cortical areas exhibited power fluctuations
              time-locked to memory encoding during the cognitive task. In the
              somatosensory association cortex, alpha power increased prior to
              stimulus presentation and decreased during memory encoding. There
              were small significant reductions in theta power in the right
              superior parietal lobule and the posterior cingulate cortex
              around memory encoding. However, the subjects did not show a
              significant change in cognitive task performance or
              electrocortical activity with walking speed. These findings
              indicate that in young, healthy subjects walking speed does not
              affect performance of a spatial working memory task. These
              subjects can devote adequate cortical resources to spatial

              being closer together in time. This effect is called intentional
              binding. Although many experiments were conducted on this
              phenomenon, the underlying neural mechanisms are not well
              understood. While intentional binding is specific to voluntary
              action, we presumed that preconscious brain activity (the
              readiness potential, RP), which occurs before an action is made,
              might play an important role in this binding effect. In this
              study, the brain dynamics were recorded with
              electroencephalography (EEG) and analyzed in single-trials in
              order to estimate whether intentional binding is correlated with
              the early neural processes. Moreover, we were interested in
              different behavioral performance between meditators and
              non-meditators since meditators are expected to be able to keep
              attention more consistently on a task. Thus, we performed the
              intentional binding paradigm with 20 mindfulness meditators and
              compared them to matched controls. Although, we did not observe a
              group effect on either behavioral data or EEG recordings, we
              found that self-initiated movements following ongoing negative
              deflections of slow cortical potentials (SCPs) result in a
              stronger binding effect compared to positive potentials,
              especially regarding the perceived time of the consequent effect.
              Our results provide the first direct evidence that the early
              neural activity within the range of SCPs affects perceived time

              for our everyday lives. It involves nearly all sensory systems,
              it requires numerous parallel computations, and it engages
              multiple memory systems. One of the key problems in this field
              pertains to the question of reference frames: spatial information
              such as direction or distance can be coded
              egocentrically-relative to an observer-or allocentrically-in a
              reference frame independent of the observer. While many studies
              have associated striatal and parietal circuits with egocentric
              coding and entorhinal/hippocampal circuits with allocentric
              coding, this strict dissociation is not in line with a growing

              place plays a crucial role in determining the processes that are
              being recruited. This has important implications, particularly
              for the inferences that can be made from animal studies in small
              scale space about the neural mechanisms supporting human spatial
              navigation in large (environmental) spaces. Furthermore, we argue
              that many of the commonly used tasks to study spatial navigation
              and the underlying neuronal mechanisms involve different types of

  abstract = "Self-motion through space generates a visual pattern called optic
              flow. It can be used to determine one's direction of self-motion
              (heading). Previous studies have already shown that this
              perceptual ability, which is of critical importance during
              everyday life, changes with age. In most of these studies
              subjects were asked to judge whether they appeared to be heading
              to the left or right of a target. Thresholds were found to
              increase continuously with age. In our current study, we were
              interested in absolute rather than relative heading judgments and
              in the question about a potential neural correlate of an
              age-related deterioration of heading perception. Two groups,
              older test subjects and younger controls, were shown optic flow
              stimuli in a virtual-reality setup. Visual stimuli simulated
              self-motion through a 3-D cloud of dots and subjects had to
              indicate their perceived heading direction after each trial. In
              different subsets of experiments we varied individually relevant
              stimulus parameters: presentation time, number of dots in the
              display, stereoscopic vs. non-stereoscopic stimulation, and
              motion coherence. We found decrements in heading performance with
              age for each stimulus parameter. In a final step we aimed to
              determine a putative neural basis of this behavioral decline. To
              this end we modified a neural network model which previously has
              proven to be capable of reproduce and predict certain aspects of
              heading perception. We show that the observed data can be modeled
              by implementing an age related neuronal cell loss in this neural
              network. We conclude that a continuous decline of certain aspects
              of motion perception, among them heading, might be based on an

  abstract = "While the widely studied allocentric spatial representation holds
              a special status in neuroscience research, its exact nature and
              neural underpinnings continue to be the topic of debate,
              particularly in humans. Here, based on a review of human
              behavioral research, we argue that allocentric representations do
              not provide the kind of map-like, metric representation one might
              expect based on past theoretical work. Instead, we suggest that
              almost all tasks used in past studies involve a combination of
              egocentric and allocentric representation, complicating both the
              investigation of the cognitive basis of an allocentric
              representation and the task of identifying a brain region
              specifically dedicated to it. Indeed, as we discuss in detail,
              past studies suggest numerous brain regions important to
              allocentric spatial memory in addition to the hippocampus,
              including parahippocampal, retrosplenial, and prefrontal
              cortices. We thus argue that although allocentric computations
              will often require the hippocampus, particularly those involving
              extracting details across temporally specific routes, the
              hippocampus is not necessary for all allocentric computations. We
              instead suggest that a non-aggregate network process involving
              multiple interacting brain areas, including hippocampus and
              extra-hippocampal areas such as parahippocampal, retrosplenial,
              prefrontal, and parietal cortices, better characterizes the
              neural basis of spatial representation during navigation.
              According to this model, an allocentric representation does not
              emerge from the computations of a single brain region (i.e.,
              hippocampus) nor is it readily decomposable into additive
              computations performed by separate brain regions. Instead, an
              allocentric representation emerges from computations partially
              shared across numerous interacting brain regions. We discuss our
              non-aggregate network model in light of existing data and provide
              several key predictions for future experiments.",

              its sensory input comes about and the inferences it draws based

              we illustrate how the Hierarchical Gaussian Filter (HGF) offers a
              principled and generic way to deal with the several forms that
              uncertainty in perception takes. The HGF is a recent derivation
              of one-step update equations from Bayesian principles that rests
              on a hierarchical generative model of the environment and its
              (in)stability. It is computationally highly efficient, allows for
              online estimates of hidden states, and has found numerous
              applications to experimental data from human subjects. In this
              paper, we generalize previous descriptions of the HGF and its
              account of perceptual uncertainty. First, we explicitly formulate
              the extension of the HGF's hierarchy to any number of levels;
              second, we discuss how various forms of uncertainty are
              accommodated by the minimization of variational free energy as
              encoded in the update equations; third, we combine the HGF with
              decision models and demonstrate the inversion of this

              four optimization methods for inverting the HGF/decision model

              optimization, variational Bayes and Markov chain Monte Carlo

              variational Bayes offering the best combination of efficiency and
              informativeness of inference. Our results demonstrate that the
              HGF provides a principled, flexible, and efficient-but at the

  abstract = "There has been a recent surge in the use of
              electroencephalography (EEG) as a tool for mobile brain imaging
              due to its portability and fine time resolution. When EEG is
              combined with independent component analysis (ICA) and source
              localization techniques, it can model electrocortical activity as
              arising from temporally independent signals located in spatially
              distinct cortical areas. However, for mobile tasks, it is not
              clear how movement artifacts influence ICA and source
              localization. We devised a novel method to collect pure movement
              artifact data (devoid of any electrophysiological signals) with a
              256-channel EEG system. We first blocked true electrocortical
              activity using a silicone swim cap. Over the silicone layer, we
              placed a simulated scalp with electrical properties similar to
              real human scalp. We collected EEG movement artifact signals from
              ten healthy, young subjects wearing this setup as they walked on
              a treadmill at speeds from 0.4-1.6 m/s. We performed ICA and
              dipole fitting on the EEG movement artifact data to quantify how
              accurately these methods would identify the artifact signals as
              non-neural. ICA and dipole fitting accurately localized 99\% of
              the independent components in non-neural locations or lacked
              dipolar characteristics. The remaining 1\% of sources had
              locations within the brain volume and low residual variances, but
              had topographical maps, power spectra, time courses, and event
              related spectral perturbations typical of non-neural sources.
              Caution should be exercised when interpreting ICA for data that
              includes semi-periodic artifacts including artifact arising from
              human walking. Alternative methods are needed for the
              identification and separation of movement artifact in mobile EEG
              signals, especially methods that can be performed in real time.
              Separating true brain signals from motion artifact could clear
              the way for EEG brain computer interfaces for assistance during

              trial-by-trial performance variations for five clinically
              relevant metrics, which accounted for reaction time as well as
              for the smoothness and precision of the produced force
              trajectory. 18 out of 20 tested subjects remained after
              preprocessing and entered offline analysis. Source Power
              Comodulation (SPoC) was applied on EEG data of a short time

  abstract = "Recent advances in electroencephalographic (EEG) acquisition
              allow for recordings using wet and dry sensors during whole-body
              motion. The large variety of commercially available EEG systems
              contrasts with the lack of established methods for objectively
              describing their performance during whole-body motion. Therefore,
              the aim of this study was to introduce methods for benchmarking
              the suitability of new EEG technologies for that context.
              Subjects performed an auditory oddball task using three different
              EEG systems (Biosemi wet-BSM, Cognionics Wet-Cwet, Conionics
              Dry-Cdry). Nine subjects performed the oddball task while seated
              and walking on a treadmill. We calculated EEG epoch rejection
              rate, pre-stimulus noise (PSN), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and
              EEG amplitude variance across the P300 event window (CVERP) from
              a subset of 12 channels common to all systems. We also calculated
              test-retest reliability and the subject's level of comfort while
              using each system. Our results showed that using the traditional
              75 $\mu$V rejection threshold BSM and Cwet epoch rejection rates
              are ~25\% and ~47\% in the seated and walking conditions
              respectively. However, this threshold rejects ~63\% of epochs for
              Cdry in the seated condition and excludes 100\% of epochs for the
              majority of subjects during walking. BSM showed predominantly no
              statistical differences between seated and walking condition for
              all metrics, whereas Cwet showed increases in PSN and CVERP, as
              well as reduced SNR in the walking condition. Data quality from
              Cdry in seated conditions were predominantly inferior in
              comparison to the wet systems. Test-retest reliability was mostly
              moderate/good for these variables, especially in seated
              conditions. In addition, subjects felt less discomfort and were
              motivated for longer recording periods while using wet EEG
              systems in comparison to the dry system. The proposed method was
              successful in identifying differences across systems that are
              mostly caused by motion-related artifacts and usability issues.
              We conclude that the extraction of the selected metrics from an
              auditory oddball paradigm may be used as a benchmark method for
              testing the performance of different EEG systems in mobile
              conditions. Moreover dry EEG systems may need substantial
              improvements to meet the quality standards of wet electrodes.",

              which this can be accomplished. However, it is difficult to
              measure these concepts in the ``wild''. We employed
              ultra-portable battery operated and wireless functional near

              hemodynamic changes in the brain's Prefrontal cortex (PFC).
              Measurements were taken during navigation of a college campus
              with either a hand-held display, or an Augmented reality wearable
              display (ARWD). Hemodynamic measures were also paired with
              secondary tasks of visual perception and auditory working memory
              to provide behavioral assessment of situation awareness and
              mental workload. Navigating with an augmented reality wearable
              display produced the least workload during the auditory working
              memory task, and a trend for improved situation awareness in our
              measures of prefrontal hemodynamics. The hemodynamics associated
              with errors were also different between the two devices. Errors
              with an augmented reality wearable display were associated with
              increased prefrontal activity and the opposite was observed for
              the hand-held display. This suggests that the cognitive

              These findings show fNIRS is a valuable tool for assessing new

              imaging approaches do not allow for an investigation of brain
              dynamics during active behavior because their sensors cannot
              follow the movement of the signal source. However, movements that
              require the operator to react fast and to adapt to a dynamically
              changing environment occur frequently in working environments
              like assembly-line work, construction trade, health care, but
              also outside the working environment like in team sports.
              Overcoming the restrictions of existing imaging methods would
              allow for deeper insights into neurocognitive processes at
              workplaces that require physical interactions and thus could help

              dynamics accompanying rapid volatile movements we used a visual
              oddball paradigm where participants had to react to color changes

              event-related potentials (ERPs) can be analyzed for simple button
              presses and physical pointing responses and that it is possible

              and eye movements to the signal recorded at the sensor level even
              for fast volatile arm movements with strong jerks. Using MoBI in
              naturalistic working environments can thus help to analyze brain

              interactions in endogenous spatial attention. The current
              research used event-related potentials (ERPs) and virtual reality
              (VR) to identify how the visual cues of the perceiver's body
              affect visuo-tactile interaction in endogenous spatial attention
              and at what point in time the effect takes place. A bimodal
              oddball task with lateralized tactile and visual stimuli was
              presented in two VR conditions, one with and one without visible
              hands, and one VR-free control with hands in view. Participants
              were required to silently count one type of stimulus and ignore
              all other stimuli presented in irrelevant modality or location.
              The presence of hands was found to modulate early and late
              components of somatosensory and visual evoked potentials. For
              sensory-perceptual stages, the presence of virtual or real hands
              was found to amplify attention-related negativity on the
              somatosensory N140 and cross-modal interaction in somatosensory
              and visual P200. For postperceptual stages, an amplified N200
              component was obtained in somatosensory and visual evoked
              potentials, indicating increased response inhibition in response
              to non-target stimuli. The effect of somatosensory, but not
              visual, N200 enhanced when the virtual hands were present. The
              findings suggest that bodily presence affects sustained
              cross-modal spatial attention between vision and touch and that
              this effect is specifically present in ERPs related to early- and
              late-sensory processing, as well as response inhibition, but do
              not affect later attention and memory-related P3 activity.

              inference. We seek to address this gap in this article by
              highlighting the utility of linking EEG and behavior, with an
              emphasis on approaches for EEG analysis that move beyond focusing
              on peaks or ``components'' derived from averaging EEG responses
              across trials and subjects (generating the event-related
              potential, ERP). First, we review methods for deriving features
              from EEG in order to enhance the signal within single-trials.
              These methods include filtering based on user-defined features
              (i.e., frequency decomposition, time-frequency decomposition),
              filtering based on data-driven properties (i.e., blind source
              separation, BSS), and generating more abstract representations of
              data (e.g., using deep learning). We then review cognitive models

              the drift diffusion model (DDM) and reinforcement learning (RL)
              approaches. Next, we discuss ways to access associations among
              these measures, including statistical models, data-driven joint
              models and cognitive joint modeling using hierarchical Bayesian
              models (HBMs). We think that these methodological tools are
              likely to contribute to theoretical advancements, and will help

              functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and scalp
              encephalography (EEG). While there is broad consensus that human
              spatial navigation involves both egocentric (self-referenced) and
              allocentric (world-referenced) coding schemes, exactly how these
              can be measured in ecologically meaningful situations remains
              controversial. Here, we explore these two forms of representation
              and how we might better measure them by reviewing commonly used
              spatial memory tasks and proposing a new task: the relative
              vector discrimination (RVD) task. Additionally, we explore how
              different encoding modalities (desktop virtual reality, immersive
              virtual reality, maps, and real-world navigation) might alter how
              egocentric and allocentric representations manifest.
              Specifically, we discuss desktop virtual reality vs. more
              immersive forms of navigation that better approximate real-world
              situations, and the extent to which less immersive encoding
              modalities alter neural and cognitive codes engaged during
              navigation more generally. We conclude that while encoding
              modality likely alters navigation-related codes to some degree,
              including egocentric and allocentric representations, it does not
              fundamentally change the underlying representations. Considering
              these arguments together, we suggest that tools to study human

              network of brain regions that represent external space has been
              identified in both humans and rodents. In rodents, much of the
              work to date has been done in situations where the animal is free
              to move about naturally. By contrast, the majority of work
              carried out to date in humans is static, due to limitations
              imposed by traditional laboratory based imaging techniques. In
              recent years, significant progress has been made in bridging the
              gap between animal and human work by employing virtual reality
              (VR) technology to simulate aspects of real-world navigation.
              Despite this progress, the VR studies often fail to fully

  abstract = "Car driving is considered a very complex activity, consisting of
              different concomitant tasks and subtasks, thus it is crucial to
              understand the impact of different factors, such as road
              complexity, traffic, dashboard devices, and external events on
              the driver's behavior and performance. For this reason, in
              particular situations the cognitive demand experienced by the
              driver could be very high, inducing an excessive experienced
              mental workload and consequently an increasing of error
              commission probability. In this regard, it has been demonstrated
              that human error is the main cause of the 57\% of road accidents
              and a contributing factor in most of them. In this study, 20
              young subjects have been involved in a real driving experiment,
              performed under different traffic conditions (rush hour and not)
              and along different road types (main and secondary streets).
              Moreover, during the driving tasks different specific events, in
              particular a pedestrian crossing the road and a car entering the
              traffic flow just ahead of the experimental subject, have been
              acted. A Workload Index based on the Electroencephalographic
              (EEG), i.e., brain activity, of the drivers has been employed to
              investigate the impact of the different factors on the driver's
              workload. Eye-Tracking (ET) technology and subjective measures
              have also been employed in order to have a comprehensive overview
              of the driver's perceived workload and to investigate the
              different insights obtainable from the employed methodologies.
              The employment of such EEG-based Workload index confirmed the
              significant impact of both traffic and road types on the drivers'
              behavior (increasing their workload), with the advantage of being
              under real settings. Also, it allowed to highlight the increased
              workload related to external events while driving, in particular
              with a significant effect during those situations when the
              traffic was low. Finally, the comparison between methodologies
              revealed the higher sensitivity of neurophysiological measures
              with respect to ET and subjective ones. In conclusion, such an
              EEG-based Workload index would allow to assess objectively the
              mental workload experienced by the driver, standing out as a
              powerful tool for research aimed to investigate drivers' behavior

              indices of cognitive states are considered as potential
              candidates relevant for driving research. These include:
              electroencephalography and event-related potentials, optical

  abstract = "Many previous studies on brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) have
              focused on electroencephalography (EEG) signals elicited during
              motor-command execution to generate device commands. However,
              exploiting pre-execution brain activity related to movement
              intention could improve the practical applicability of BMIs.
              Therefore, in this study we investigated whether EEG signals
              occurring before movement execution could be used to classify
              movement intention. Six subjects performed reaching tasks that
              required them to move a cursor to one of four targets distributed
              horizontally and vertically from the center. Using independent
              components of EEG acquired during a premovement phase, two-class
              classifications were performed for left vs. right trials and top
              vs. bottom trials using a support vector machine. Instructions
              were presented visually (test) and aurally (condition). In the
              test condition, accuracy for a single window was about 75\%, and
              it increased to 85\% in classification using two windows. In the
              control condition, accuracy for a single window was about 73\%,
              and it increased to 80\% in classification using two windows.
              Classification results showed that a combination of two windows
              from different time intervals during the premovement phase
              improved classification performance in the both conditions
              compared to a single window classification. By categorizing the
              independent components according to spatial pattern, we found
              that information depending on the modality can improve
              classification performance. We confirmed that EEG signals

              Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) signals has gained significant
              momentum, and fNIRS joined the set of modalities frequently used
              for active and passive Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI). A great
              variety of methods for feature extraction and classification have
              been explored using state-of-the-art Machine Learning methods. In
              contrast, signal preprocessing and cleaning pipelines for fNIRS
              often follow simple recipes and so far rarely incorporate the
              available state-of-the-art in adjacent fields. In neuroscience,
              where fMRI and fNIRS are established neuroimaging tools, evoked
              hemodynamic brain activity is typically estimated across multiple
              trials using a General Linear Model (GLM). With the help of the
              GLM, subject, channel, and task specific evoked hemodynamic
              responses are estimated, and the evoked brain activity is more
              robustly separated from systemic physiological interference using
              independent measures of nuisance regressors, such as
              short-separation fNIRS measurements. When correctly applied in
              single trial analysis, e.g., in BCI, this approach can
              significantly enhance contrast to noise ratio of the brain
              signal, improve feature separability and ultimately lead to
              better classification accuracy. In this manuscript, we provide a
              brief introduction into the GLM and show how to incorporate it
              into a typical BCI preprocessing pipeline and cross-validation.
              Using a resting state fNIRS data set augmented with synthetic
              hemodynamic responses that provide ground truth brain activity,
              we compare the quality of commonly used fNIRS features for BCI
              that are extracted from (1) conventionally preprocessed signals,
              and (2) signals preprocessed with the GLM and physiological
              nuisance regressors. We show that the GLM-based approach can
              provide better single trial estimates of brain activity as well
              as a new feature type, i.e., the weight of the individual and
              channel-specific hemodynamic response function (HRF) regressor.
              The improved estimates yield features with higher separability,
              that significantly enhance accuracy in a binary classification
              task when compared to conventional preprocessing-on average
              +7.4\% across subjects and feature types. We propose to adapt
              this well-established approach from neuroscience to the domain of
              single-trial analysis and preprocessing wherever the
              classification of evoked brain activity is of concern, for

              Interpersonal synchrony of many rhythmic (periodic) behaviors
              displays dynamics of coupled biological oscillators. The current
              study addresses oscillatory dynamics on the levels of brain and
              behavior between music duet partners performing at spontaneous
              (uncued) rates. Wireless EEG was measured from N = 20 pairs of
              pianists as they performed a melody first in Solo performance (at
              their spontaneous rate of performance), and then in Duet
              performances at each partner's spontaneous rate. Influences of
              partners' spontaneous rates on interpersonal synchrony were
              assessed by correlating differences in partners' spontaneous
              rates of Solo performance with Duet tone onset asynchronies.
              Coupling between partners' neural oscillations was assessed by
              correlating amplitude envelope fluctuations of cortical
              oscillations at the Duet performance frequency between observed
              partners and between surrogate (re-paired) partners, who
              performed the same melody but at different times. Duet
              synchronization was influenced by partners' spontaneous rates in
              Solo performance. The size and direction of the difference in
              partners' spontaneous rates were mirrored in the size and
              direction of the Duet asynchronies. Moreover, observed Duet
              partners showed greater inter-brain correlations of oscillatory
              amplitude fluctuations than did surrogate partners, suggesting
              that performing in synchrony with a musical partner is reflected
              in coupled cortical dynamics at the performance frequency. The
              current study provides evidence that dynamics of oscillator
              coupling are reflected in both behavioral and neural measures of

  abstract = "To offer engaging neurorehabilitation training to neurologic
              patients, motor tasks are often visualized in virtual reality
              (VR). Recently introduced head-mounted displays (HMDs) allow to
              realistically mimic the body of the user from a first-person
              perspective (i.e., avatar) in a highly immersive VR environment.
              In this immersive environment, users may embody avatars with
              different body characteristics. Importantly, body characteristics
              impact how people perform actions. Therefore, alternating body
              perceptions using immersive VR may be a powerful tool to promote
              motor activity in neurologic patients. However, the ability of
              the brain to adapt motor commands based on a perceived modified
              reality has not yet been fully explored. To fill this gap, we
              ``tricked the brain'' using immersive VR and investigated if
              multisensory feedback modulating the physical properties of an
              embodied avatar influences motor brain networks and control. Ten
              healthy participants were immersed in a virtual environment using
              an HMD, where they saw an avatar from first-person perspective.
              We slowly transformed the surface of the avatar (i.e., the ``skin
              material'') from human to stone. We enforced this visual change
              by repetitively touching the real arm of the participant and the
              arm of the avatar with a (virtual) hammer, while progressively
              replacing the sound of the hammer against skin with stone hitting
              sound via loudspeaker. We applied single-pulse transcranial
              magnetic simulation (TMS) to evaluate changes in motor cortical
              excitability associated with the illusion. Further, to
              investigate if the ``stone illusion'' affected motor control,
              participants performed a reaching task with the human and stone
              avatar. Questionnaires assessed the subjectively reported
              strength of embodiment and illusion. Our results show that
              participants experienced the ``stone arm illusion.''
              Particularly, they rated their arm as heavier, colder, stiffer,
              and more insensitive when immersed with the stone than human
              avatar, without the illusion affecting their experienced feeling
              of body ownership. Further, the reported illusion strength was
              associated with enhanced motor cortical excitability and faster
              movement initiations, indicating that participants may have
              physically mirrored and compensated for the embodied body
              characteristics of the stone avatar. Together, immersive VR has
              the potential to influence motor brain networks by subtly
              modifying the perception of reality, opening new perspectives for
              the motor recovery of patients.",

              are a big challenge in the transfer of common findings in
              cognitive workload estimation using Electroencephalography (EEG)
              from laboratory experiments to realistic scenarios or other
              experiments. Additionally, it often remains an open question
              whether actual cognitive workload reflected by brain signals was
              the main contribution to the estimation or discriminative and
              class-dependent muscle and eye activity, which can be secondary
              effects of changing workload levels. Within this study, we
              investigated a novel approach to spatial filtering based on
              beamforming adapted to changing settings. We compare it to no
              spatial filtering and Common Spatial Patterns (CSP). We used a
              realistic maneuvering task, as well as an auditory n-back
              secondary task on a tugboat simulator as two different conditions
              to induce workload changes on professional tugboat captains.
              Apart from the typical within condition classification, we
              investigated the ability of the different classification methods
              to transfer between the n-back condition and the maneuvering
              task. The results show a clear advantage of the proposed approach
              over the others in the challenging transfer setting. While no
              filtering leads to lowest within-condition normalized
              classification loss on average in two scenarios (22 and 10\%),
              our approach using adaptive beamforming (30 and 18\%) performs
              comparably to CSP (33 and 15\%). Importantly, in the transfer
              from one to another setting, no filtering and CSP lead to
              performance around chance level (45 to 53\%), while our approach
              in contrast is the only one capable of classifying in all other
              scenarios (34 and 35\%) with a significant difference from chance
              level. The changing signal composition over the scenarios leads
              to a need to adapt the spatial filtering in order to be
              transferable. With our approach, the transfer is successful due
              to filtering being optimized for the extraction of neural

              reliable results. However, some applications such as
              brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) require single-trial estimation
              methods. In this paper, we present SCoT-a source connectivity
              toolbox for Python. This toolbox implements routines for blind
              source decomposition and connectivity estimation with the MVARICA
              approach. Additionally, a novel extension called CSPVARICA is
              available for labeled data. SCoT estimates connectivity from
              various spectral measures relying on vector autoregressive (VAR)
              models. Optionally, these VAR models can be regularized to
              facilitate ill posed applications such as single-trial fitting.
              We demonstrate basic usage of SCoT on motor imagery (MI) data.

              constitutes an important component of conducting research and

              a more comprehensive view of brain states implicated in behavior

              techniques are limited in their ability to reliably localize
              sources across subjects. We propose an algorithmic and
              computational framework for identifying cortical networks across
              subjects in which dynamic causal connectivity is modeled among
              user-selected cortical regions of interest (ROIs). We demonstrate
              the strength of the proposed framework using a ``reach/saccade to
              spatial target'' cognitive task performed by 10 right-handed
              individuals. Modeling of causal cortical interactions was
              accomplished through measurement of cortical activity using
              (EEG), application of independent component clustering to
              identify cortical ROIs as network nodes, estimation of cortical
              current density using cortically constrained low resolution
              electromagnetic brain tomography (cLORETA), multivariate
              autoregressive (MVAR) modeling of representative cortical
              activity signals from each ROI, and quantification of the dynamic
              causal interaction among the identified ROIs using the Short-time

              generate artifact patterns across scalp EEG sensors. There are
              many methods for identifying and rejecting bad channels and
              independent components from EEG datasets, but there is a lack of
              methods dedicated to evaluate specific intra-channel amplitude
              patterns for identifying motion-related artifacts. In this study,
              we proposed a template correlation rejection (TCR) as a novel
              method for identifying and rejecting EEG channels and independent
              components carrying motion-related artifacts. We recorded EEG
              data from 10 subjects during treadmill walking. The template
              correlation rejection method consists of creating templates of
              amplitude patterns and determining the fraction of total epochs
              presenting relevant correlation to the template. For EEG
              channels, the template correlation rejection removed channels
              presenting the majority of epochs (>75\%) correlated to the
              template, and presenting pronounced amplitude in comparison to
              all recorded channels. For independent components, the template
              correlation rejection removed components presenting the majority
              of epochs correlated to the template. Evaluation of scalp maps
              and power spectra confirmed low neural content for the rejected
              components. We found that channels identified for rejection
              contained ~60\% higher delta power, and had spectral properties
              locked to the gait phases. After rejecting the identified
              channels and running independent component analysis on the EEG
              datasets, the proposed method identified 4.3 $\pm$ 1.8
              independent components (out of 198 $\pm$ 12) with substantive
              motion-related artifacts. These results indicate that template
              correlation rejection is an effective method for rejecting EEG

              comprehensive 3-D EEG data structure including all trials and all
              participants maintaining the original order of recording. This
              allows straightforward access to subsets of the data based on any
              information available in a behavioral data structure matched with
              the EEG data (experimental conditions, but also performance
              indicators, such accuracy or RTs of single trials). In the
              present study we exploit this structure to compute linear mixed
              models (LMMs, using lmer in R) including random intercepts and
              slopes for items. This information can easily be read out from
              the matched behavioral data, whereas it might not be accessible

  abstract = "Electroencephalography (EEG) source localization approaches are
              often used to disentangle the spatial patterns mixed up in scalp
              EEG recordings. However, approaches differ substantially between
              experiments, may be strongly parameter-dependent, and results are
              not necessarily meaningful. In this paper we provide a pipeline
              for EEG source estimation, from raw EEG data pre-processing using
              EEGLAB functions up to source-level analysis as implemented in
              Brainstorm. The pipeline is tested using a data set of 10
              individuals performing an auditory attention task. The analysis
              approach estimates sources of 64-channel EEG data without the
              prerequisite of individual anatomies or individually digitized
              sensor positions. First, we show advanced EEG pre-processing
              using EEGLAB, which includes artifact attenuation using
              independent component analysis (ICA). ICA is a linear
              decomposition technique that aims to reveal the underlying
              statistical sources of mixed signals and is further a powerful
              tool to attenuate stereotypical artifacts (e.g., eye movements or
              heartbeat). Data submitted to ICA are pre-processed to facilitate
              good-quality decompositions. Aiming toward an objective approach
              on component identification, the semi-automatic CORRMAP algorithm
              is applied for the identification of components representing
              prominent and stereotypic artifacts. Second, we present a
              step-wise approach to estimate active sources of auditory cortex
              event-related processing, on a single subject level. The
              presented approach assumes that no individual anatomy is
              available and therefore the default anatomy ICBM152, as
              implemented in Brainstorm, is used for all individuals.
              Individual noise modeling in this dataset is based on the
              pre-stimulus baseline period. For EEG source modeling we use the
              OpenMEEG algorithm as the underlying forward model based on the
              symmetric Boundary Element Method (BEM). We then apply the method
              of dynamical statistical parametric mapping (dSPM) to obtain
              physiologically plausible EEG source estimates. Finally, we show
              how to perform group level analysis in the time domain on
              anatomically defined regions of interest (auditory scout). The
              proposed pipeline needs to be tailored to the specific datasets
              and paradigms. However, the straightforward combination of EEGLAB
              and Brainstorm analysis tools may be of interest to others

              signals were used as decoding features for further offline
              analysis. Average binary classification accuracy for grasping vs.
              the no-movement condition peaked at 75.06 $\pm$ 6.8\%. Peak
              average accuracy for grasping vs. grasping conditions of 64.95

              $\pm$ 6.8\% at 1.45 s after the movement onset. The analysis of
              MRCPs indicated that all the grasping conditions are more

              significant differences between the grasping conditions. These

  abstract = "Gait is a common but rather complex activity that supports
              mobility in daily life. It requires indeed sophisticated
              coordination of lower and upper limbs, controlled by the nervous
              system. The relationship between limb kinematics and muscular
              activity with neural activity, referred to as neurokinematic and
              neuromuscular connectivity (NKC/NMC) respectively, still needs to
              be elucidated. Recently developed analysis techniques for mobile
              high-density electroencephalography (hdEEG) recordings have
              enabled investigations of gait-related neural modulations at the
              brain level. To shed light on gait-related neurokinematic and
              neuromuscular connectivity patterns in the brain, we performed a
              mobile brain/body imaging (MoBI) study in young healthy
              participants. In each participant, we collected hdEEG signals and
              limb velocity/electromyography signals during treadmill walking.
              We reconstructed neural signals in the alpha (8-13 Hz), beta
              (13-30 Hz), and gamma (30-50 Hz) frequency bands, and assessed
              the co-modulations of their power envelopes with
              myogenic/velocity envelopes. Our results showed that the myogenic
              signals have larger discriminative power in evaluating
              gait-related brain-body connectivity with respect to kinematic
              signals. A detailed analysis of neuromuscular connectivity
              patterns in the brain revealed robust responses in the alpha and
              beta bands over the lower limb representation in the primary
              sensorimotor cortex. There responses were largely contralateral
              with respect to the body sensor used for the analysis. By using a
              voxel-wise analysis of variance on the NMC images, we revealed
              clear modulations across body sensors; the variability across
              frequency bands was relatively lower, and below significance.
              Overall, our study demonstrates that a MoBI platform based on
              hdEEG can be used for the investigation of gait-related
              brain-body connectivity. Future studies might involve more
              complex walking conditions to gain a better understanding of
              fundamental neural processes associated with gait control, or
              might be conducted in individuals with neuromotor disorders to
              identify neural markers of abnormal gait.",

  title    = "The functional significance of delta oscillations in cognitive
              processing",
  author   = "Harmony, Thal{\'\i}a",
  abstract = "Ample evidence suggests that electroencephalographic (EEG)
              oscillatory activity is linked to a broad variety of perceptual,
              sensorimotor, and cognitive operations. However, few studies have
              investigated the delta band (0.5-3.5 Hz) during different
              cognitive processes. The aim of this review is to present data
              and propose the hypothesis that sustained delta oscillations
              inhibit interferences that may affect the performance of mental
              tasks, possibly by modulating the activity of those networks that
              should be inactive to accomplish the task. It is clear that two
              functionally distinct and potentially competing brain networks
              can be broadly distinguished by their contrasting roles in
              attention to the external world vs. the internally directed
              mentation or concentration. During concentration, EEG delta
              (1-3.5 Hz) activity increases mainly in frontal leads in
              different tasks: mental calculation, semantic tasks, and the
              Sternberg paradigm. This last task is considered a working memory
              task, but in neural, as well as phenomenological, terms, working
              memory can be best understood as attention focused on an internal
              representation. In the Sternberg task, increases in power in the
              frequencies from 1 to 3.90 Hz in frontal regions are reported. In
              a Go/No-Go task, power increases at 1 Hz in both conditions were
              observed during 100-300 ms in central, parietal and temporal
              regions. However, in the No-Go condition, power increases were
              also observed in frontal regions, suggesting its participation in
              the inhibition of the motor response. Increases in delta power
              were also reported during semantic tasks in children. In
              conclusion, the results suggest that power increases of delta
              frequencies during mental tasks are associated with functional
              cortical deafferentation, or inhibition of the sensory afferences
              that interfere with internal concentration. These inhibitory
              oscillations would modulate the activity of those networks that
              should be inactive to accomplish the task.",

              normally has two engines to enhance energy efficiency and reduce
              CO2 output. Similarly, a hybrid brain-computer interface (BCI) is
              composed of two BCIs, or at least one BCI and another system. A
              hybrid BCI, like any BCI, must fulfill the following four
              criteria: (i) the device must rely on signals recorded directly
              from the brain; (ii) there must be at least one recordable brain
              signal that the user can intentionally modulate to effect
              goal-directed behaviour; (iii) real time processing; and (iv) the
              user must obtain feedback. This paper introduces hybrid BCIs that
              have already been published or are in development. We also
              introduce concepts for future work. We describe BCIs that
              classify two EEG patterns: one is the event-related
              (de)synchronisation (ERD, ERS) of sensorimotor rhythms, and the
              other is the steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP). Hybrid
              BCIs can either process their inputs simultaneously, or operate
              two systems sequentially, where the first system can act as a
              ``brain switch''. For example, we describe a hybrid BCI that
              simultaneously combines ERD and SSVEP BCIs. We also describe a
              sequential hybrid BCI, in which subjects could use a brain switch
              to control an SSVEP-based hand orthosis. Subjects who used this
              hybrid BCI exhibited about half the false positives encountered
              while using the SSVEP BCI alone. A brain switch can also rely on
              hemodynamic changes measured through near-infrared spectroscopy
              (NIRS). Hybrid BCIs can also use one brain signal and a different
              type of input. This additional input can be an
              electrophysiological signal such as the heart rate, or a signal
              from an external device such as an eye tracking system.",

  abstract = "In most cognitive neuroscience experiments there are many
              behavioral and experimental dynamics, and many indices of brain
              activity, that vary from trial to trial. For example, in studies
              of response conflict, conflict is usually treated as a binary
              variable (i.e., response conflict exists or does not in any given
              trial), whereas some evidence and intuition suggests that
              conflict may vary in intensity from trial to trial. Here we
              demonstrate that single-trial multiple regression of
              time-frequency electrophysiological activity reveals neural
              mechanisms of cognitive control that are not apparent in

              oscillation phase coherence and synchronization analyses, based
              on ``weighted'' phase modulation, that has advantages over
              standard coherence measures in terms of linking
              electrophysiological dynamics to trial-varying behavior and
              experimental variables. After replicating previous response

  abstract = "Evidence has amassed from both animal intracranial recordings and
              human electrophysiology that neural oscillatory mechanisms play a
              critical role in a number of cognitive functions such as
              learning, memory, feature binding and sensory gating. The wide
              availability of high-density electrical and magnetic recordings
              (64-256 channels) over the past two decades has allowed for
              renewed efforts in the characterization and localization of these
              rhythms. A variety of cognitive effects that are associated with
              specific brain oscillations have been reported, which range in
              spectral, temporal, and spatial characteristics depending on the
              context. Our laboratory has focused on investigating the role of
              alpha-band oscillatory activity (8-14 Hz) as a potential
              attentional suppression mechanism, and this particular
              oscillatory attention mechanism will be the focus of the current
              review. We discuss findings in the context of intersensory
              selective attention as well as intrasensory spatial and
              feature-based attention in the visual, auditory, and tactile
              domains. The weight of evidence suggests that alpha-band
              oscillations can be actively invoked within cortical regions
              across multiple sensory systems, particularly when these regions
              are involved in processing irrelevant or distracting information.
              That is, a central role for alpha seems to be as an attentional

  abstract = "Perception is the foundation of cognition and is fundamental to
              our beliefs and consequent action planning. The Editorial (this
              issue) asks: ``what mechanisms, if any, mediate between
              perceptual and cognitive processes?'' It has recently been argued
              that attention might furnish such a mechanism. In this paper, we
              pursue the idea that action planning (motor preparation) is an
              attentional phenomenon directed toward kinesthetic signals. This
              rests on a view of motor control as active inference, where
              predictions of proprioceptive signals are fulfilled by peripheral
              motor reflexes. If valid, active inference suggests that
              attention should not be limited to the optimal biasing of
              perceptual signals in the exteroceptive (e.g., visual) domain but
              should also bias proprioceptive signals during movement. Here, we
              investigate this idea using a classical attention (Posner)
              paradigm cast in a motor setting. Specially, we looked for
              decreases in reaction times when movements were preceded by valid
              relative to invalid cues. Furthermore, we addressed the
              hierarchical level at which putative attentional effects were
              expressed by independently cueing the nature of the movement and
              the hand used to execute it. We found a significant interaction
              between the validity of movement and effector cues on reaction
              times. This suggests that attentional bias might be mediated at a
              low level in the motor hierarchy, in an intrinsic frame of
              reference. This finding is consistent with attentional enabling
              of top-down predictions of proprioceptive input and may rely upon
              the same synaptic mechanisms that mediate directed spatial
              attention in the visual system.",

              potentially to improve their performance in the near future. At
              least three types of behavioral post-error adjustments have been
              observed. These are post-error slowing (PES), post-error
              reduction of interference, and post-error improvement in accuracy
              (PIA). Apart from these behavioral changes, post-error
              adaptations have also been observed on a neuronal level with
              functional magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography.
              Neuronal post-error adaptations comprise activity increase in
              task-relevant brain areas, activity decrease in
              distracter-encoding brain areas, activity modulations in the
              motor system, and mid-frontal theta power increases. Here, we

              signal processing such as event-related spectral perturbation
              (ERSP) - and its variant event-related synchronization and
              event-related desynchronization - have been used over the past 20
              years. They represent average spectral changes in response to a
              stimulus. These spectral methods do not have strong consensus for
              comparing pre- and post-stimulus activity. When computing ERSP,
              pre-stimulus baseline removal is usually performed after
              averaging the spectral estimate of multiple trials. Correcting
              the baseline of each single-trial prior to averaging spectral

              tasks such as giving complex directions or orienting themselves
              on maps. How are these spontaneous gestures related to spatial
              problem-solving? We measured spontaneous movements during a
              perspective-taking task inspired by map reading. Analyzing the
              motion data to isolate rotation and translation components of
              motion in specific geometric relation to the task, we found out
              that most participants executed spontaneous miniature rotations
              of the head that were significantly related to the main task
              parameter. These head rotations were as if participants were
              trying to align themselves with the orientation on the map either
              in the image plane or on the ground plane, but with tiny
              amplitudes, typically below 1\% of the actual movements. Our
              results are consistent with a model of sensorimotor prediction
              driving spatial reasoning. The efference copy of planned
              movements triggers this prediction mechanism. The movements
              themselves may then be mostly inhibited; the small spontaneous

  author   = "Wilson, Andrew D and Golonka, Sabrina",
  abstract = "The most exciting hypothesis in cognitive science right now is
              the theory that cognition is embodied. Like all good ideas in
              cognitive science, however, embodiment immediately came to mean
              six different things. The most common definitions involve the
              straight-forward claim that ``states of the body modify states of
              the mind.'' However, the implications of embodiment are actually
              much more radical than this. If cognition can span the brain,
              body, and the environment, then the ``states of mind'' of
              disembodied cognitive science won't exist to be modified.
              Cognition will instead be an extended system assembled from a
              broad array of resources. Taking embodiment seriously therefore
              requires both new methods and theory. Here we outline four key
              steps that research programs should follow in order to fully
              engage with the implications of embodiment. The first step is to
              conduct a task analysis, which characterizes from a first person
              perspective the specific task that a perceiving-acting cognitive
              agent is faced with. The second step is to identify the
              task-relevant resources the agent has access to in order to solve
              the task. These resources can span brain, body, and environment.
              The third step is to identify how the agent can assemble these
              resources into a system capable of solving the problem at hand.
              The last step is to test the agent's performance to confirm that
              agent is actually using the solution identified in step 3. We
              explore these steps in more detail with reference to two useful
              examples (the outfielder problem and the A-not-B error), and
              introduce how to apply this analysis to the thorny question of
              language use. Embodied cognition is more than we think it is, and

  abstract = "Some objects in our environment are strongly tied to motor
              actions, a phenomenon called object affordance. A cup, for
              example, affords us to reach out to it and grasp it by its
              handle. Studies indicate that merely viewing an affording object
              triggers motor activations in the brain. The present study
              investigated whether object affordance would also result in an
              attention bias, that is, whether observers would rather attend to
              graspable objects within reach compared to non-graspable but
              reachable objects or to graspable objects out of reach. To this
              end, we conducted a combined reaction time and motion tracking
              study with a table in a virtual three-dimensional space. Two
              objects were positioned on the table, one near, the other one far
              from the observer. In each trial, two graspable objects, two
              non-graspable objects, or a combination of both was presented.
              Participants were instructed to detect a probe appearing on one
              of the objects as quickly as possible. Detection times served as
              indirect measure of attention allocation. The motor association
              with the graspable object was additionally enhanced by having
              participants grasp a real object in some of the trials. We
              hypothesized that visual attention would be preferentially
              allocated to the near graspable object, which should be reflected
              in reduced reaction times in this condition. Our results confirm
              this assumption: probe detection was fastest at the graspable
              object at the near position compared to the far position or to a
              non-graspable object. A follow-up experiment revealed that in
              addition to object affordance per se, immediate graspability of
              an affording object may also influence this near-space advantage.
              Our results suggest that visuospatial attention is preferentially
              allocated to affording objects which are immediately graspable,
              and thus establish a strong link between an object' s motor

              for the development of (implicit) motor chunks and explicit
              sequence knowledge than middle-aged (55-62 years; Verwey et al.,
              2011) and elderly participants (75-88 years; Verwey, 2010).
              Still, even in the absence of indications for motor chunks, the
              middle-aged and elderly participants showed some performance
              improvement too. This was attributed to a sequence learning
              mechanism in which individual reactions are primed by implicit
              sequential knowledge. The present work further examined
              sequential movement skill across these age groups. We explored
              the consequences of making an error on the execution of a

              variable trials) is problematic. In the present study, we
              analyzed EEG data from a previous experiment, which compared ERP
              responses to highly expected words that were placed either in a
              MWE or a regular non-fixed compositional context, and to low
              predictability controls. We focused on oscillatory dynamics and
              regression analyses, in order to dissociate between the two

              compositional contexts when the target word appeared later on in
              the sentence, confirming that in the former lexical retrieval
              would have taken place before word onset. On the other hand,
              gamma-power (~50-70 Hz) was also modulated by predictability of

              psychological research in the last two decades. This technology,
              with its unique ability to simulate complex, real situations and
              contexts, offers researchers unprecedented opportunities to
              investigate human behavior in well controlled designs in the
              laboratory. One important application of VR is the investigation
              of pathological processes in mental disorders, especially anxiety
              disorders. Research on the processes underlying threat
              perception, fear, and exposure therapy has shed light on more
              general aspects of the relation between perception and emotion.
              Being by its nature virtual, i.e., simulation of reality, VR
              strongly relies on the adequate selection of specific perceptual
              cues to activate emotions. Emotional experiences in turn are
              related to presence, another important concept in VR, which
              describes the user's sense of being in a VR environment. This
              paper summarizes current research into perception of fear cues,
              emotion, and presence, aiming at the identification of the most
              relevant aspects of emotional experience in VR and their mutual
              relations. A special focus lies on a series of recent experiments
              designed to test the relative contribution of perception and
              conceptual information on fear in VR. This strand of research
              capitalizes on the dissociation between perception (bottom-up
              input) and conceptual information (top-down input) that is
              possible in VR. Further, we review the factors that have so far
              been recognized to influence presence, with emotions (e.g., fear)
              being the most relevant in the context of clinical psychology.
              Recent research has highlighted the mutual influence of presence
              and fear in VR, but has also traced the limits of our current
              understanding of this relationship. In this paper, the crucial
              role of perception on eliciting emotional reactions is
              highlighted, and the role of arousal as a basic dimension of
              emotional experience is discussed. An interoceptive attribution
              model of presence is suggested as a first step toward an
              integrative framework for emotion research in VR. Gaps in the

              representations, and evolutionary context, and how we might use
              the built environment to suit who we are, or how it creates who
              we are. In particular we investigate how two spatial reference

              Heller, Laurie M",
  abstract = "Actions that produce sounds infuse our daily lives. Some of these
              sounds are a natural consequence of physical interactions (such
              as a clang resulting from dropping a pan), but others are
              artificially designed (such as a beep resulting from a keypress).
              Although the relationship between actions and sounds has
              previously been examined, the frame of reference of these
              associations is still unknown, despite it being a fundamental
              property of a psychological representation. For example, when an
              association is created between a keypress and a tone, it is
              unclear whether the frame of reference is egocentric
              (gesture-sound association) or exocentric (key-sound
              association). This question is especially important for
              artificially created associations, which occur in technology that
              pairs sounds with actions, such as gestural interfaces, virtual
              or augmented reality, and simple buttons that produce tones. The
              frame of reference could directly influence the learnability, the
              ease of use, the extent of immersion, and many other factors of
              the interaction. To explore whether action-sound associations are
              egocentric or exocentric, an experiment was implemented using a
              computer keyboard's number pad wherein moving a finger from one
              key to another produced a sound, thus creating an action-sound
              association. Half of the participants received egocentric
              instructions to move their finger with a particular gesture. The
              other half of the participants received exocentric instructions
              to move their finger to a particular number on the keypad. All
              participants were performing the same actions, and only the
              framing of the action varied between conditions by altering task
              instructions. Participants in the egocentric condition learned
              the gesture-sound association, as revealed by a priming paradigm.
              However, the exocentric condition showed no priming effects. This
              finding suggests that action-sound associations are egocentric in
              nature. A second part of the same session further confirmed the
              egocentric nature of these associations by showing no change in
              the priming effect after moving to a different starting location.
              Our findings are consistent with an egocentric representation of
              action-sound associations, which could have implications for
              applications that utilize these associations.",

              spatial ability and verbal memory in 153 boys and girls between
              6- to 12-years-old. Children completed a battery of spatial

              Also, rmcorr tends to have much greater statistical power because

              A Systematic Review",

  abstract = "The published literature has produced several definitions for the
              sense of presence in a simulated environment, as well as various
              methods for measuring it. The variety of conceptualizations makes
              it difficult for researchers to interpret, compare, and evaluate
              the presence ratings obtained from individual studies. Presence
              has been measured by employing questionnaires, physiological
              indices, behavioral feedbacks, and interviews. A systematic
              literature review was conducted to provide insight into the
              definitions and measurements of presence in studies from 2002 to
              2019, with a focus on questionnaires and physiological measures.
              The review showed that scholars had introduced various
              definitions of presence that often originate from different
              theoretical standpoints and that this has produced a multitude of
              different questionnaires that aim to measure presence. At the
              same time, physiological studies that investigate the
              physiological correlates of the sense of presence have often
              shown ambiguous results or have not been replicated. Most of the
              scholars have preferred the use of questionnaires, with Witmer
              and Singer's Presence Questionnaire being the most prevalent.
              Among the physiological measures, electroencephalography was the
              most frequently used. The conclusions of the present review aim
              to stimulate future structured efforts to standardize the use of
              the construct of presence, as well as inspire the replication of
              the findings reported in the published literature.",

              (EEG) potential prior to voluntary action and was first described
              by Kornhuber and Deecke (1965). Recent studies have demonstrated
              that a few subjects do not exhibit standard RP before voluntary
              action. In our previous study, we also found that some subjects
              did not show an early RP preceding instructed action. Although
              this phenomenon may be meaningful, no studies have yet
              investigated its origins. In the present study, we designed and
              implemented an experimental paradigm involving voluntary and
              instructed actions in the form of hand movements from 29 subjects
              with concurrent acquisition of EEGs. According to whether the
              subjects showed a standard RP waveform during instructed action,
              they were divided into the SHOW and NOSHOW group. Then, the RPs
              and voltage topographies were plotted for each group. Finally,
              the slope of each epoch at the early RP phase was estimated. We
              showed that early RPs were absent in 14 of 29 subjects during
              instructed actions. Besides, based on the slow cortical potential
              (SCP) sampling hypothesis, we also showed a decreased proportion
              in the negative potential for the NOSHOW group. Our results
              suggested that early RP is absent among approximately half of
              subjects during instructed action and that the decreased
              proportion of negative potential shifts may account for the
              absence of early RP in the NOSHOW group.",

  abstract = "Healthy biological systems exhibit complex patterns of
              variability that can be described by mathematical chaos. Heart
              rate variability (HRV) consists of changes in the time intervals
              between consecutive heartbeats called interbeat intervals (IBIs).
              A healthy heart is not a metronome. The oscillations of a healthy
              heart are complex and constantly changing, which allow the
              cardiovascular system to rapidly adjust to sudden physical and
              psychological challenges to homeostasis. This article briefly
              reviews current perspectives on the mechanisms that generate 24
              h, short-term (~5 min), and ultra-short-term (<5 min) HRV, the
              importance of HRV, and its implications for health and
              performance. The authors provide an overview of widely-used HRV
              time-domain, frequency-domain, and non-linear metrics.
              Time-domain indices quantify the amount of HRV observed during
              monitoring periods that may range from ~2 min to 24 h.
              Frequency-domain values calculate the absolute or relative amount
              of signal energy within component bands. Non-linear measurements
              quantify the unpredictability and complexity of a series of IBIs.
              The authors survey published normative values for clinical,
              healthy, and optimal performance populations. They stress the
              importance of measurement context, including recording period
              length, subject age, and sex, on baseline HRV values. They
              caution that 24 h, short-term, and ultra-short-term normative
              values are not interchangeable. They encourage professionals to
              supplement published norms with findings from their own
              specialized populations. Finally, the authors provide an overview

  abstract = "The idea that the brain learns generative models of the world has
              been widely promulgated. Most approaches have assumed that the
              brain learns an explicit density model that assigns a probability
              to each possible state of the world. However, explicit density
              models are difficult to learn, requiring approximate inference
              techniques that may find poor solutions. An alternative approach
              is to learn an implicit density model that can sample from the
              generative model without evaluating the probabilities of those
              samples. The implicit model can be trained to fool a
              discriminator into believing that the samples are real. This is
              the idea behind generative adversarial algorithms, which have
              proven adept at learning realistic generative models. This paper
              develops an adversarial framework for probabilistic computation

              algorithms overcome some of the problems that vex prior theories

  abstract = "AI is one of the most debated subjects of today and there seems
              little common understanding concerning the differences and
              similarities of human intelligence and artificial intelligence.
              Discussions on many relevant topics, such as trustworthiness,
              explainability, and ethics are characterized by implicit
              anthropocentric and anthropomorphistic conceptions and, for
              instance, the pursuit of human-like intelligence as the golden
              standard for Artificial Intelligence. In order to provide more
              agreement and to substantiate possible future research
              objectives, this paper presents three notions on the similarities
              and differences between human- and artificial intelligence: 1)
              the fundamental constraints of human (and artificial)
              intelligence, 2) human intelligence as one of many possible forms
              of general intelligence, and 3) the high potential impact of
              multiple (integrated) forms of narrow-hybrid AI applications. For
              the time being, AI systems will have fundamentally different
              cognitive qualities and abilities than biological systems. For
              this reason, a most prominent issue is how we can use (and
              ``collaborate'' with) these systems as effectively as possible?
              For what tasks and under what conditions, decisions are safe to
              leave to AI and when is human judgment required? How can we
              capitalize on the specific strengths of human- and artificial
              intelligence? How to deploy AI systems effectively to complement
              and compensate for the inherent constraints of human cognition
              (and vice versa)? Should we pursue the development of AI
              ``partners'' with human (-level) intelligence or should we focus
              more at supplementing human limitations? In order to answer these
              questions, humans working with AI systems in the workplace or in
              policy making have to develop an adequate mental model of the
              underlying 'psychological' mechanisms of AI. So, in order to
              obtain well-functioning human-AI systems, Intelligence Awareness
              in humans should be addressed more vigorously. For this purpose a
              first framework for educational content is proposed.",

              collocated from a first-person perspective. When doing so,
              participants have the feeling that the own body has been
              substituted by the self-avatar, and that the new body is the
              source of the sensations. Embodiment is complex as it includes
              not only body ownership over the avatar, but also agency,
              co-location, and external appearance. Despite the multiple
              variables that influence it, the illusion is quite robust, and it
              can be produced even if the self-avatar is of a different age,
              size, gender, or race from the participant's own body. Embodiment
              illusions are therefore the basis for many social VR experiences
              and a current active research area among the community.
              Researchers are interested both in the body manipulations that
              can be accepted, as well as studying how different self-avatars

              varies between participants. In this paper, we review the

               reality-virtuality (RV) continuum has been used to frame virtual
               and augmented reality research and development. While
               originally, the RV continuum and the three dimensions of the
               supporting taxonomy (extent of world knowledge, reproduction
               fidelity, and extent of presence metaphor) were intended to
               characterize the capabilities of visual display technology,
               researchers have embraced the RV continuum while largely
               ignoring the taxonomy. Considering the leaps in technology made
               over the last 25 years, revisiting the RV continuum and taxonomy
               is timely. In reexamining Milgram and Kishino's ideas, we
               realized, first, that the RV continuum is actually
               discontinuous; perfect virtual reality cannot be reached.
               Secondly, mixed reality is broader than previously believed,
               and, in fact, encompasses conventional virtual reality

               accounting for the role of users, which is critical to assessing
               modern mixed reality experiences. The 3D space created by our
               taxonomy incorporates familiar constructs such as presence and

              thought of as the sense of ``being there'' in the virtual world.
              We argued in a 2009 paper that presence consists of two
              orthogonal illusions that we refer to as Place Illusion (PI, the
              illusion of being in the place depicted by the VR) and
              Plausibility (Psi, the illusion that the virtual situations and
              events are really happening). Both are with the proviso that the
              participant in the virtual reality knows for sure that these are
              illusions. Presence (PI and Psi) together with the illusion of
              ownership over the virtual body that self-represents the
              participant, are the three key illusions of virtual reality.
              Copresence, togetherness with others in the virtual world, can be
              a consequence in the context of interaction between remotely
              located participants in the same shared virtual environments, or
              between participants and virtual humans. We then review several
              different methods of measuring presence: questionnaires,
              physiological and behavioural measures, breaks in presence, and a
              psychophysics method based on transitions between different
              system configurations. Presence is not the only way to assess the
              responses of people to virtual reality experiences, and we
              present methods that rely solely on participant preferences,
              including the use of sentiment analysis that allows participants
              to express their experience in their own words rather than be
              required to adopt the terminology and concepts of researchers. We
              discuss several open questions and controversies that exist in
              this field, providing an update to the 2009 paper, in particular
              with respect to models of Plausibility. We argue that
              Plausibility is the most interesting and complex illusion to
              understand and is worthy of significant more research. Regarding
              measurement we conclude that the ideal method would be a
              combination of a psychophysical method and qualitative methods
              including sentiment analysis.",

              brain-activity measurement, behavioral measurement, and
              computational modeling. Using measured brain-activity patterns to
              evaluate computational network models is complicated by the need
              to define the correspondency between the units of the model and
              the channels of the brain-activity data, e.g., single-cell
              recordings or voxels from functional magnetic resonance imaging
              (fMRI). Similar correspondency problems complicate relating
              activity patterns between different modalities of brain-activity
              measurement (e.g., fMRI and invasive or scalp electrophysiology),
              and between subjects and species. In order to bridge these
              divides, we suggest abstracting from the activity patterns
              themselves and computing representational dissimilarity matrices
              (RDMs), which characterize the information carried by a given
              representation in a brain or model. Building on a rich
              psychological and mathematical literature on similarity analysis,
              we propose a new experimental and data-analytical framework
              called representational similarity analysis (RSA), in which
              multi-channel measures of neural activity are quantitatively
              related to each other and to computational theory and behavior by
              comparing RDMs. We demonstrate RSA by relating representations of
              visual objects as measured with fMRI in early visual cortex and
              the fusiform face area to computational models spanning a wide
              range of complexities. The RDMs are simultaneously related via
              second-level application of multidimensional scaling and tested
              using randomization and bootstrap techniques. We discuss the
              broad potential of RSA, including novel approaches to
              experimental design, and argue that these ideas, which have deep
              roots in psychology and neuroscience, will allow the integrated
              quantitative analysis of data from all three branches, thus
              contributing to a more unified systems neuroscience.",

               mental workload will cause a waste of human resources. It is
               very significant to study the mental workload status of
               operators. The existing mental workload classification method is
               based on electroencephalogram (EEG) features, and its
               classification accuracy is often low because the channel signals
               recorded by the EEG electrodes are a group of mixed brain
               signals, which are similar to multi-source mixed speech signals.
               It is not wise to directly analyze the mixed signals in order to
               distinguish the feature of EEG signals. In this study, we
               propose a mental workload classification method based on EEG
               independent components (ICs) features, which borrows from the
               blind source separation (BSS) idea of mixed speech signals. This
               presented method uses independent component analysis (ICA) to
               obtain pure signals, i.e., ICs. The energy features of ICs are
               directly extracted for classifying the mental workload, since
               this method directly uses ICs energy features for feature
               extraction. Compared with the existing solution, the proposed
               method can obtain better classification results. The presented

              explicit task and implicit emotional attention between 2D and VR
              stimulation. Participants (n = 16) viewed angry and neutral faces

              the late positive potential (LPP) and the target P300, were

              each of which is dedicated to the prediction of the intention to
              move a specific finger. Regions of the brain that are sensitive

              sense, interact with, and manage their own physiological and
              mental states. Neurofeedback has been applied to a wide variety
              of psychiatric illnesses, as well as to treat sub-clinical
              symptoms, and even to enhance performance in healthy populations.
              Despite growing interest, there persists a level of distrust
              and/or bias in the medical and research communities in the USA
              toward neurofeedback and other functional interventions. As a
              result, neurofeedback has been largely ignored, or disregarded
              within social neuroscience. We propose a systematic,
              empirically-based approach for assessing the effectiveness, and
              utility of neurofeedback. To that end, we use the term
              perturbative physiologic plasticity to suggest that biological
              systems function as an integrated whole that can be perturbed and
              guided, either directly or indirectly, into different
              physiological states. When the intention is to normalize the
              system, e.g., via neurofeedback, we describe it as self-directed
              neuroplasticity, whose outcome is persistent functional,

              physiological, neuropsychological, behavioral, interpersonal, and

              objective indices and as the metrics necessary for assessing

              neurofeedback on functional connectivity in a few clinical
              disorders as case studies for this approach. We believe this

              investigate if and how cortical oscillatory dynamics are altered
              by 10 min of continuous cervical tSCS. Participants performed

               (1) mindsets can be extracted in a motion trajectory in target
               selection, and (2) a dynamic state-space model, such as the
               Kalman filter, helps quantify mindsets. Participants were
               experimentally manipulated to hold fixed or growth mindsets in a
               ``mock'' memory test, and later performed a concept-learning
               task in which the movement of the computer cursor was recorded
               in every trial. By inspecting motion trajectories of the cursor,
               we observed clear disparities in the impact of mindsets;
               participants who were induced with a fixed mindset moved the
               cursor faster as compared to those who were induced with a
               growth mindset. To examine further the mechanism of this
               influence, we fitted a Kalman filter model to the trajectory
               data; we found that system-level error-covariance in the Kalman
               filter model could effectively separate motion trajectories
               gleaned from the two mindset conditions. Taken together, results
               from the experiment suggest that people's mindsets can be
               captured in motor trajectories in target selection and the
               Kalman filter helps quantify mindsets. It is argued that
               people's personality, attitude, and mindset are embodied in
               motor behavior underlying target selection and these

              embodied intrinsic measures, such as idiothetic information

              distance reproduction task in which participants traveled an
              outbound distance and then reproduced that distance using the
              same or a different action mode. The extrinsic model predicted
              that distance reproduction should be invariant across action
              modes, whereas the intrinsic model predicted invariance only
              within an action mode. In Experiment 1, we held the outbound mode
              constant while varying the response mode (walk-walk, walk-throw)

              Trials started with two stimuli oriented towards the observer and
              two stimuli pointing into the periphery. Simultaneous to target
              presentation, one direct stimulus changed to averted and one

              interpret this as a bias towards an implicitly expected outcome.
              Second, expectation did not influence the perception of all types

               mind-wandering or on-task. To be able to examine the task

               inserted at random moments, and participants' responses to the
               probes were used to create labels for the classifier. The 6

              higher-order patterns defined across interoceptive and

               participants, with a small to medium effect size (d = 0.34 to

  author   = "Gardony, Aaron L and Taylor, Holly A and Bruny{\'e}, Tad T",
  abstract = "Sketch maps are effective tools for assessing spatial memory.
              However, despite their widespread use in cognitive science
              research, sketch map analysis techniques remain unstandardized
              and carry limitations. In the present article, we present the
              Gardony Map Drawing Analyzer (GMDA), an open-source software
              package for sketch map analysis. GMDA combines novel and
              established analysis techniques into a graphical user interface
              that permits rapid computational sketch map analysis. GMDA
              calculates GMDA-unique measures based on pairwise comparisons
              between landmarks, as well as bidimensional regression parameters
              (Friedman \& Kohler, 2003), which together reflect sketch map
              quality at two levels: configural and individual landmark. The
              configural measures assess the overall landmark configuration and
              provide a whole-map analysis. Individual landmark measures,
              introduced in GMDA, assess individual landmark placement and
              indicate how individual landmarks contribute to the configural
              scores. Together, these measures provide a more complete
              psychometric picture of sketch map analysis, allowing for
              comparisons between sketch maps and between landmarks. The
              calculated measures reflect specific and cognitively relevant
              aspects of interlandmark spatial relationships, including
              distance and angular representation. GMDA supports complex
              environments (up to 48 landmarks) and two software modes that
              capture aspects of maps not addressed by existing techniques,
              such as landmark size and shape variation and interlandmark
              containment relationships. We describe the software and its
              operation and present a formal specification of calculation
              procedures for its unique measures. We then validate the software
              by demonstrating the capabilities and reliability of its measures
              using simulation and experimental data. The most recent version
              of GMDA is available at

               (AOIs): Researchers in the same field often use widely varying
               AOIs for similar stimuli, making cross-study comparisons
               difficult or even impossible. Subjective choices while choosing
               AOIs cause differences in AOI shape, size, and location. On the
               other hand, not many guidelines for constructing AOIs, or
               comparisons between AOI-production methods, are available. In
               the present study, we addressed this gap by comparing
               AOI-production methods in face stimuli, using data collected
               with infants and adults (with autism spectrum disorder [ASD] and
               matched controls). Specifically, we report that the
               attention-attracting and attention-maintaining capacities of
               AOIs differ between AOI-production methods, and that this
               matters for statistical comparisons in one of three groups
               investigated (the ASD group). In addition, we investigated the
               relation between AOI size and an AOI's attention-attracting and
               attention-maintaining capacities, as well as the consequences
               for statistical analyses, and report that adopting large AOIs
               solves the problem of statistical differences between the AOI
               methods. Finally, we tested AOI-production methods for their
               robustness to noise, and report that large AOIs-using the
               Voronoi tessellation method or the limited-radius Voronoi
               tessellation method with large radii-are most robust to noise.
               We conclude that large AOIs are a noise-robust solution in face
               stimuli and, when implemented using the Voronoi method, are the
               most objective of the researcher-defined AOIs. Adopting Voronoi

  abstract = "The Tobii Eyex Controller is a new low-cost binocular eye tracker
              marketed for integration in gaming and consumer applications. The
              manufacturers claim that the system was conceived for natural eye
              gaze interaction, does not require continuous recalibration, and
              allows moderate head movements. The Controller is provided with a
              SDK to foster the development of new eye tracking applications.
              We review the characteristics of the device for its possible use
              in scientific research. We develop and evaluate an open source
              Matlab Toolkit that can be employed to interface with the EyeX
              device for gaze recording in behavioral experiments. The Toolkit
              provides calibration procedures tailored to both binocular and
              monocular experiments, as well as procedures to evaluate other
              eye tracking devices. The observed performance of the EyeX (i.e.
              accuracy < 0.6°, precision < 0.25°, latency < 50 ms and sampling
              frequency $\approx$55 Hz), is sufficient for some classes of

              measure fixation parameters, saccadic, smooth pursuit and
              vergence eye movements. However, the relatively low sampling rate
              and moderate precision limit the suitability of the EyeX for
              monitoring micro-saccadic eye movements or for real-time
              gaze-contingent stimulus control. For these applications,
              research grade, high-cost eye tracking technology may still be
              necessary. Therefore, despite its limitations with respect to
              high-end devices, the EyeX has the potential to further the
              dissemination of eye tracking technology to a broad audience, and
              could be a valuable asset in consumer and gaming applications as

               the eye-tracker's headbox, the area where tracking is possible.
               As such, remote eye-trackers are marketed as allowing the
               reliable recording of gaze from participant groups that cannot
               be restrained, such as infants, schoolchildren and patients with
               muscular or brain disorders. Practical experience and previous
               research, however, tells us that eye-tracking data quality, e.g.
               the accuracy of the recorded gaze position and the amount of
               data loss, deteriorates (compared to well-trained participants
               in chinrests) when the participant is unrestrained and assumes a
               non-optimal pose in front of the eye-tracker. How then can
               researchers working with unrestrained participants choose an
               eye-tracker? Here we investigated the performance of five
               popular remote eye-trackers from EyeTribe, SMI, SR Research, and
               Tobii in a series of tasks where participants took on
               non-optimal poses. We report that the tested systems varied in
               the amount of data loss and systematic offsets observed during
               our tasks. The EyeLink and EyeTribe in particular had large
               problems. Furthermore, the Tobii eye-trackers reported data for
               two eyes when only one eye was visible to the eye-tracker. This
               study provides practical insight into how popular remote
               eye-trackers perform when recording from unrestrained
               participants. It furthermore provides a testing method for
               evaluating whether a tracker is suitable for studying a certain
               target population, and that manufacturers can use during the
               development of new eye-trackers.",

  abstract = "It is commonly recognized that free-hand sketch maps are
              influenced by systematic cognitive impacts and therefore sketch
              maps are incomplete, distorted, and schematized. This makes it
              impossible to achieve a one-to-one alignment between a sketch map
              and its corresponding `real' metric map. Nevertheless, sketch
              maps are still useful to communicate about spatial knowledge,
              which indicates that they contain invariant spatial information
              that is robust against cognitive impacts. In existing studies,
              sketch maps are usually used as basic measures of spatial and
              environmental information extracted from cognitive maps. However,
              the study of invariant spatial information in sketch maps remains
              a void. We aim to explore such information from a cognitive
              perspective. This paper first introduces four basic spatial
              objects identified in sketch maps, proposes a set of sketch
              aspects that capture invariant spatial information and then
              evaluates their accuracy and reliability: We collected sketch
              maps from experiments and analysed different types of spatial
              relations of spatial objects. Based on spatial and statistical
              analyses, we propose a set of seven sketch aspects that
              constitute invariant spatial information, along with a spatial
              analysis method to measure them. The findings of these aspects
              help to understand which spatial information is preserved under
              the transformation from the physical world to sketch maps. It
              also lends cognitive support for the alignment of sketch and

              primary importance, ensuring that movements remain
              well-calibrated and accurate. A large body of work on reaching

              electrophysiological responses from subsequent events often

              influence the measured responses in a linear or non-linear
              fashion. Examples of paradigms where systematic temporal overlap
              variations and low-level confounds between conditions cannot be
              avoided include combined electroencephalogram (EEG)/eye-tracking
              experiments during natural vision, fast multisensory stimulation

              massive univariate modeling (``regression-ERPs''), linear

              generalized additive model into one coherent and flexible

              includes advanced options for regularization and the use of

              commonly used for measuring presence; their use in the field,
              advantages, and disadvantages. Subjective measures rely on
              self-assessment by the user. Users answer questions such as ``How
              real did the environment seem to you?'', ``Was the environment
              like a place you visited, or a series of images presented to
              you?''. Behavioral measures examine actions or manners exhibited
              by the user that are responses to objects or events in the
              virtual environment. For example, does the user duck if a virtual
              object is thrown at his head. Physiological methods attempt to
              measure presence by gauging changes in the subject's heart rate,
              skin temperature, skin conductance, breathing rate, etc. In a

               out which light switch or oven burner to turn on, or whether to
               push, pull, or slide a door. The fault, argues this
               ingenious-even liberating-book, lies not in ourselves, but in
               product design that ignores the needs of users and the
               principles of cognitive psychology. The problems range from
               ambiguous and hidden controls to arbitrary relationships between
               controls and functions, coupled with a lack of feedback or other
               assistance and unreasonable demands on memorization. The Design
               of Everyday Things shows that good, usable design is possible.
               The rules are simple: make things visible, exploit natural
               relationships that couple function and control, and make
               intelligent use of constraints. The goal: guide the user
               effortlessly to the right action on the right control at the
               right time. In this entertaining and insightful analysis,
               cognitive scientist Don Norman hails excellence of design as the
               most important key to regaining the competitive edge in
               influencing consumer behavior. Now fully expanded and updated,
               with a new introduction by the author, The Design of Everyday
               Things is a powerful primer on how-and why-some products satisfy

               used outside laboratories , due to a poor reliability. It is
               thus necessary to study and fix this reliability issue. Doing so
               requires to use appropriate reliability metrics to quantify both
               signal processing and user learning performances. So far,
               Classification Accuracy (CA) is the typical metric used for both
               aspects. However, we argue in this paper that CA is a poor
               metric to study how well users are learning to use the BCI.
               Indeed CA is notably unspecific, discrete, training data and
               classifier dependent, and as such may not always reflect
               successful EEG pattern self-modulation by the user. We thus
               propose new performance metrics to specifically measure how
               distinct and stable the EEG patterns produced by the user are.
               By re-analyzing EEG data with these metrics, we indeed confirm
               that CA may hide some learning effects or hide the user
               inability to self-modulate a given EEG pattern.",

              called Hjorth surface Laplacian (Hjorth, 1975) because, despite
              its frequent mention in EEG research, the Hjorth algorithm for
              calculating the two-dimensional second derivative is valid only
              for evenly spaced data points falling on an orthogonal Cartesian
              grid (Press et al., 1992). This is not the case for conventional
              EEG electrode arrays, which seek even spacing but do not
              generally follow a Cartesian grid (Tucker, 1991). Instead, we
              describe the calculation of the surface Laplacian based upon two
              common methods of spline interpolation: the spherical splines
              (Perrin et al., 1989; 1990) and the three-dimensional thin-plate
              splines (Perrin et al., 1987; Law et al., 1993). Each method is

              research however poses significant constraints on system
              performanceand stability. In particular, studies with multimodal
              measurement of human behavior and physiology require precise
              hardware-software synchronization with precise event labeling
              (within 10 milliseconds). Previous works investigating
              suitability of VRsystems for research have mainly focused on
              benchmarking performance in spatial tracking. Therefore, it
              remains unclear iftiming parameters such as latency or jitter in
              VR motion capture and VR audiovisual stimulation allow for
              carrying out scienceunder strong time constraints. Here we
              present the first quantitative test of time performance in VR
              input and VR feedback of thecurrent state-of-the-art HTC Vive Pro
              system. Using both low-level Python-based API and a high-level
              game engine (Unity), ourmultilevel testing procedure allows us to
              isolate software influence on observed results. We report that,
              in both test conditions,latencies are non-negligible considering
              fine synchronization with multimodal measurements; however,
              jitters are stable andlow, which allows to counter-balance the
              effect of latency by using constant offsets to re-synchronize
              multimodal data. Finally,we plan to share our testing hardware
              setup as an open-source and low-cost benchmark toolkit, allowing

  abstract    = "This paper develops a representation-theoretic notion of
                 spatial context for cognitive agents interacting with spatial
                 environments. We discuss the current state of the art in
                 defining context as used in context-aware and/or location-
                 aware systems. In contrast to existing approaches, we define
                 context through cognitive processes. The term
                 {\~A}\textcent{}{\^a}‚$\neg${\"E}{\oe}invisible
                 geography{\~A}\textcent{}{\^a}‚$\neg${\^a}„\textcent{} alludes
                 to the fact that knowledge about geographic space develops
                 through complex cognitive interaction and is not simply
                 {\~A}\textcent{}{\^a}‚$\neg${\"E}{\oe}out
                 there{\~A}\textcent{}{\^a}‚$\neg${\^a}„\textcent{} to be
                 looked at. Placing (cognitive) processes in the focus of our
                 context definition allows for a truly user-centered
                 perspective: conceptualizations imbue spatial structures with
                 meaning. This allows for fixing terminological problems and
                 relating context definitions to work in spatial information
                 theory and cognitive science. Although we focus on spatial
                 context, the approach is generic and can be adapted to other
                 domains in which cognitive aspects concerning users of
                 information systems are central.",

  abstract = "Drawing on the disciplines of neurophysiology and physics,
              Neuromechanics of Human Movement, Fourth Edition, explores how
              the nervous system controls the actions of muscles to produce
              human motion in relation to biomechanical principles. This
              contemporary approach is much different from the traditional
              approach, which focuses solely on mechanics and does not consider
              the role of the sensory system in the control of human movement.
              Neuromechanics of Human Movement, Fourth Edition, provides a
              scientific foundation to the study of human movement, and as such
              it uses precise terms and definitions when discussing ideas and
              utilizing the international metric system (SI). Readers will find
              an appendix that helps in identifying the SI metric units as well
              as other learning tools, including a glossary of terms and two
              other appendixes that cover conversion factors and equations.
              Throughout the text, the content is visually reinforced with more
              than 750 illustrations, many of which are new or upgraded from
              the previous edition and include specific illustrations of the
              neuromechanics involved in sport and rehabilitation movements.
              Finally, the text contains more than 1,500 updated references and
              suggested reading lists for each chapter. To further enhance this
              fourth edition, significant content updates have been made to
              ensure the latest information is presented for both research and
              clinical environments: -New coverage regarding electromyography
              (EMG) that demonstrates the connection between the nervous system
              and the muscle by measuring the activation signal, allowing
              readers to better understand how motion is activated -Additional
              examples that underscore recent research developments in reaching
              and grasping activities for rehabilitation -In-depth coverage of
              the motor system that addresses excitable membranes, muscle and
              motor units, and voluntary movement -Expanded discussion of
              neuromuscular system adaptations to the aging process
              -Neuromuscular system adaptations with particular application to
              rehabilitation To encourage a comprehensive learning experience,
              this updated edition follows a logical progression where each
              part builds on the material from the previous section. It begins
              with an introduction to the biomechanical terms and concepts
              commonly used to describe movement, focusing on the relation
              between force and motion. Once readers have grasped the basic
              laws of motion, the text continues by considering the essential
              neurophysiological concepts that help to explain movement
              produced by the nervous system and muscle. The author uses a
              ``bottom-up'' approach for this explanation that begins with the
              principles of electricity and extends up to connections within
              the cerebral cortex. This approach encompasses the essentials of
              electricity responsible for the excitability of cell membranes
              and explains the relations between spinal neurons and muscle
              fibers. The third and final part of the text concludes by
              describing the ways in which the motor system adapts to various
              types of physical stress. These adapative capabilities include
              altering core temperature, phenomena such as strength and power
              training, adaptations that occur after periods of reduced
              activity, motor recovery from injury; and changes that occur with
              aging. Readers will understand how acute adjustments can be made
              to the motor system through interventions such as warm-up,
              flexibility, muscle soreness, and muscle fatigue. The fourth
              edition of Neuromechanics of Human Movementprovides a scientific
              basis for the study of human movement while continuing to expand
              current knowledge in the fields of biomechanics and
              neurophysiology. By integrating these fields in a unique
              framework, this text offers professionals and students both
              valuable clinical information and inspiration to deepen their
              study of human movement.",

               the development of eye tracking technology, there has been a
               growing interest in monitoring and measuring these movements,
               with a view to understanding how we attend to and process the
               visual information we encounter Eye tracking as a research tool
               is now more accessible than ever, and is growing in popularity
               amongst researchers from a whole host of different disciplines.

               reading researchers, psycholinguists, neurophysiologists,
               electrical engineers, and others, all have a vested interest in
               eye tracking for different reasons. The ability to record
               eye-movements has helped advance our science and led to
               technological innovations. However, the growth of eye tracking
               in recent years has also presented a variety of challenges - in
               particular the issue of how to design an eye-tracking
               experiment, and how to analyse the data. This book is a much
               needed comprehensive handbook of eye tracking methodology. It
               describes how to evaluate and acquire an eye-tracker, how to
               plan and design an eye tracking study, and how to record and
               analyse eye-movement data. Besides technical details and theory,
               the heart of this book revolves around practicality - how raw
               data samples are converted into fixations and saccades using
               event detection algorithms, how the different representations of
               eye movement data are calculated using AOIs, heat maps and
               scanpaths, and how all the measures of eye movements relate to
               these processes. Part I presents the technology and skills
               needed to perform high-quality research with eye-trackers. Part
               II covers the predominant methods applied to the data which
               eye-trackers record. These include the parsing of raw sample
               data into oculomotor events, and how to calculate other
               representations of eye movements such as heat maps and
               transition matrices. Part III gives a comprehensive outline of
               the measures which can be calculated using the events and
               representations described in Part II. This is a taxonomy of the
               measures available to eye-tracking researchers, sorted by type
               of movement of the eyes and type of analysis. For anyone in the
               sciences considering conducting research involving eye-tracking,
               this book will be an essential reference work.",

               trajectories as a graph, where the nodes correspond to poses and
               the edges indicate pose similarities. We optimize this graph
               using least squares minimization and non-maximum suppression to
               obtain a generalized model for the respective action. The
               resulting motion models can then be used to recognize actions in
               unlabeled motion capturing data. Experiments based on real-world
               data show that the learned motion models can reliably classify a
               large set of different motions. Furthermore, we show that the
               learned models robustly generalize over different people.",

  abstract = "The key challenges of actionable knowledge discovery come from
              the data complexity, which often manifests as a high
              dimensionality of data spaces, where each measured quantity adds
              a new axis. The key bottleneck in the data analysis and
              understanding is an effective visualization; it is a bridge
              between the quantitative content of the data, and the human
              intuition and pattern recognition. Visualization is essential at
              every step: from data cleaning and preparation, the choice of
              appropriate analysis algorithms, the interpretation of their
              output, and the final presentation of the results. The premium is
              in visualizing effectively as many dimensions of the data space
              as possible: if there are structures in the data that involve
              multiple variables, e.g., clusters, correlations, gaps, outliers,
              etc., projecting them on a standard 2D plot hides or destroys
              such information. Virtual Reality (VR) offers a powerful new
              platform for an effective visualization of high-dimensionality
              data spaces, where the users (who can be geographically
              separated) can interact with the data, machine intelligence and
              analysis tools, and collaborate with each other in a shared
              virtual environment. Immersion amplifies the ability to grasp the
              relationships and patterns that may be present in the data, more
              effectively than in any traditional visualization platform, and
              even discover patterns that are impossible to see in any other
              way. We have developed an innovative data visualization and
              analytics platform that combines a multi-dimensional data
              visualization with a variety of Machine Learning tools, and that
              enables a collaborative data visualization in VR, using commodity
              VR headsets. We will illustrate its application on a variety of
              practical examples, and provide some comparisons of its
              effectiveness as compared to the traditional data visualization

              Virtual Reality developments. Whereas display and interaction
              fidelity (as sub-dimensions of immersion) and their influence on

              psychological approaches to vision rest on the idea that when we
              see, the brain produces an internal representation of the world.
              The activation of this internal representation is assumed to give
              rise to the experience of seeing. The problem with this kind of
              approach is that it leaves unexplained how the existence of such
              a detailed internal representation might produce visual
              consciousness. An alternative proposal is made here. We propose
              that seeing is a way of acting. It is a particular way of
              exploring the environment. Activity in internal representations
              does not generate the experience of seeing. The out- side world
              serves as its own, external, representation. The experience of
              seeing occurs when the organism masters what we call the gov-
              erning laws of sensorimotor contingency. The advantage of this
              approach is that it provides a natural and principled way of
              accounting for visual consciousness, and for the differences in
              the perceived quality of sensory experience in the different
              sensory modalities. Sev- eral lines of empirical evidence are

               isn't enough: 3D user interfaces (3D UIs) must be carefully
               designed for optimal user experience. 3D User Interfaces: Theory
               and Practice, Second Edition is today's most comprehensive
               primary reference to building outstanding 3D UIs. Four pioneers
               in 3D user interface research and practice have extensively
               expanded and updated this book, making it today's definitive
               source for all things related to state-of-the-art 3D
               interaction. This edition goes far beyond VR, covering the full
               spectrum of emerging applications for 3D UIs, and presenting an
               extraordinary array of pioneering techniques and technologies.
               The authors combine theoretical foundations, analysis of devices
               and techniques, empirically validated design guidelines, and
               much more. Throughout each chapter, they illustrate key concepts
               with running case studies on gaming, mobile AR, and robot
               teleoperation. You'll find authoritative, accessible coverage of
               all this, and much more: Essentials of HCI and human factors
               (for thousands of students and practitioners now entering the
               field) How 3D UIs have evolved, and the hard problems that
               remain 3D UIs in console gaming, VR, augmented reality (AR),
               robot teleoperation, mobile/wearable computers, and remote
               collaboration How 3D input/output enables users to perceive and
               act much as they do in the physical world 3D output devices,
               including visual, auditory, haptic, and tactile displays 3D
               input devices, including traditional, special purpose, and
               direct human input via biosignals (e.g., brain input) 3D
               interaction techniques for common tasks such as selection,
               manipulation, navigation, and system control Strategies for
               designing and developing 3D UIs, including the use of 2D
               interaction; magic vs. natural interaction techniques;
               multimodal interaction, and two-handed interaction Evaluating
